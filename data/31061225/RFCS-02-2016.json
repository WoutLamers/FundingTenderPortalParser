New and improved steelmaking and finishing techniques</strong></p><p>This objective aims to improve steel production processes with a view to enhancing product quality and increasing productivity. Reducing emissions, energy consumption and the environmental impact as well as enhancing the use of raw materials and the conservation of resources are an integral part of this improvements. Proposals shall address one or more of the following areas:</p><p>(a) new and improved iron-ore reduction processes; (b) ironmaking processes and operations; (c) electric arc furnace processes; (d) steelmaking processes; (e) secondary metallurgy techniques; (f) continuous casting and near net shape-casting techniques with and without direct rolling; (g) rolling, finishing and coating techniques; (h) hot- and cold-rolling techniques, pickling and finishing processes; (i) process instrumentation, control and automation; (j) maintenance and reliability of production lines.</p><p><strong>2. RTD and the utilisation of steel</strong></p><p>RTD related to the utilisation of steel is undertaken to meet the future requirements of steel users and to create new market opportunities. Proposals shall address one or more of the following areas:</p><p>(a) new steel grades for demanding applications; (b) steel properties addressing mechanical properties at low and high temperatures such as strength and toughness, fatigue, wear, creep, corrosion and resistance against fracture; (c) prolonging service life, in particular by improving the resistance of steels and steel structures to heat and corrosion; (d) steel-containing composites and sandwich structures; (e) predictive simulation models on microstructures and mechanical properties; (f) structural safety and design methods, in particular with regard to resistance to fire and earthquakes; (g) technologies relating to the forming, welding and joining of steel and other materials; (h) standardisation of testing and evaluation methods.</p><p><strong>3. Conservation of resources and improvement of working conditions</strong></p><p>In both steel production and steel utilisation, the conservation of resources, the preservation of the ecosystem and safety issues forms an integral part of the RTD work. Proposals shall address one or more of the following areas:</p><p>(a) techniques for recycling obsolete steel from various sources and classification of steel scrap; (b) steel grades and design of assembled structures to facilitate the easy recovery of steel scrap and its reconversion into usable steels; (c) control and protection of the environment in and around the workplace; (d) restoration of steelworks sites; (e) improvement of working conditions and quality of life in the workplace; (f) ergonomic methods; (g) occupational health and safety; (h) reduction of exposure to occupational emissions.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding:</span></strong> All specific rules for participation and submission of proposals under this call, including the rules for funding and the information on countries entitled to apply for financial assistance, are described in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2016_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2016</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2016_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2016</a>. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.1. <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</span></strong> described in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2016_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2016</a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.2. <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">For submission and evaluation process</span></strong>, see the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2016_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2016</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Information on the outcome of the evaluation: maximum 6 months from the final date for submission.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/pt/rfcs-call-pt-2016_en.pdf\">Proposal Template (for all types of action)</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-rpj-2016_en.pdf\">Evaluation Form for Research Projects</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-pdp-2016_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for Pilot and Demonstration Projects</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-am-2016_en.pdf\">Evaluation Form for Accompanying Measures</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/mga/rfcs-mga-core-13_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement -
