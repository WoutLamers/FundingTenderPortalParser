Coal remains the main energy source for some EU countries (93% of Polish electricity is produced from coal). There is no doubt that this resource finds a preeminent role in a balanced energy mix for Europe. Consequently, Europe must develop critical clean coal technologies, carbon sequestration technology for existing and future coal-fired plants for electricity production, and increased efficiency in the entire extraction and utilisation cycle.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> </p><ol>  <li>Research projects (RFCS-RPJ) </li>  <li>Pilot and demonstration projects (RFCS-PDP) </li>  <li>Accompanying measures (RFCS-AM)</li> </ol><p><u>Technical groups relevant to the Coal topic:</u> </p><ol>  <li>TGC1 : Coal mining operation, mine infrastructure and management, unconventional use of coal deposits</li>  <li>TGC2 : Coal preparation, conversion and upgrading</li>  <li>TGC3 : Coal combustion, clean and efficient coal technologies, CO2 capture</li> </ol>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: #003366\"><strong>Rules for participation and guide for proposal preparation, submission and evaluation:&nbsp; </strong></span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/rfcs-call-infopack2014_en.pdf\">Information Package 2014, volume I (Infopack).</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Annual priorities 2014:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/rfcs-pricoal2014_en.pdf\">Priorities 2014 for Coal</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n    </span>&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the Information Package for page limits, and refer to proposal templates (see section 5 below) for the layout.&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Information on the outcome of the evaluation: maximum 6 months from the final date for submission.<br />\r\n    Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em>NOTA: Editable templates are available at step 5 of the Submission Service (Edit proposal).</em><em><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </em><u>Research projects (RFCS-RPJ): </u><strong><u>Funding rate: 60%</u></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    A research project shall be intended to cover investigative or experimental work with the aim of acquiring further knowledge to facilitate the attainment of specific practical objectives such as the creation or development of products, production processes or services.&nbsp;<br />\r\n    -
