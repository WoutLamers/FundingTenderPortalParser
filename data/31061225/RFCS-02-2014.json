The programme covers core production processes; new products and applications, quality control, utilisation and conversion of resources, safety at work; environmental protection by reduction of emissions from coal use and steel production, and social issues. A world leader in the steel industry, notably in the design and production of high added-value grades of steel, the European steel industry is facing increasingly fierce competition from external producers. Advanced research is essential for European industry to remain competitive. As the world continues to rely on steel in the years to come in ever larger quantities, advanced sustainable and cleaner production techniques must clearly be developed and implemented. Europe stands a unique chance to lead worldwide in this domain. </p><p><u>Type of action:</u> </p><ol>  <li>Research projects (RFCS-RPJ) </li>  <li>Pilot and demonstration projects (RFCS-PDP) </li>  <li>Accompanying measures (RFCS-AM)</li> </ol><p><u>Technical groups relevant to the Steel topic:</u> </p><ol>  <li>TGS1 : Ore agglomeration and Ironmaking</li>  <li>TGS2 : Steelmaking processes</li>  <li>TGS3 : Casting</li>  <li>TGS4 : Hot and cold rolling processes </li>  <li>TGS5 : Finishing and coating </li>  <li>TGS6 : Physical metallurgy and design of new generic steel grades </li>  <li>TGS7 : Steel products and applications for automobiles, packaging and home appliances </li>  <li>TGS8 : Steel products and applications for building, construction and industry </li>  <li>TGS9 : Factorywide control, social and environmental issues </li> </ol>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Rules for participation and guide for proposal preparation, submission and evaluation: </span></strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/rfcs-call-infopack2014_en.pdf\">Information Package 2014, volume I (Infopack)</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Annual priorities 2014: </span></strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/rfcs-pristeel2014_en.pdf\">Priorities 2014 for Steel</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the Information Package for page limits, and refer to proposal templates (see section 5 below) for the layout.&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Information on the outcome of the evaluation: maximum 6 months from the final date for submission.<br />\r\n    Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em>NOTA: Editable templates are available at step 5 of the Submission Service (Edit proposal).<br />\r\n    </em><br />\r\n    <u>Research projects (RFCS-RPJ): </u><strong><u>Funding rate: 60%</u></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    A research project shall be intended to cover investigative or experimental work with the aim of acquiring further knowledge to facilitate the attainment of specific practical objectives such as the creation or development of products, production processes or services. <br />\r\n    -
