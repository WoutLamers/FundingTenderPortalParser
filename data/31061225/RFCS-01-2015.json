Moreover, the growing international dimension of the coal market and the global scale of the problems confronting it means that the European Union has to take a leading role in meeting challenges relating to modern techniques, mine safety and environmental protection at worldwide level by ensuring the transfer of know-how required for further technological progress, improved working conditions (health and safety) and enhanced environmental protection.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals submitted under this topic must relate to one of the following research objectives (see Art 4 to 7 of Council Decision 2008/376/EC).</p><p><strong>1. Improving the competitive position of Community coal</strong></p><p>This objective aims at reducing the total costs of mining production, improving the quality of the products and reducing the costs of using coal. This may relate to any phase in the coal production chain:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>modern techniques for surveying deposits;</li>  <li>behaviour and control of deposits in relation to rock pressure, gas emissions, the risk of explosion, ventilation and all other factors affecting mining operations;</li>  <li>integrated mine planning;</li>  <li>highly efficient, largely automated excavation and new and existing mining technologies corresponding to the geological characteristics of European hard coal deposits;</li>  <li>appropriate support technologies;</li>  <li>transport systems;</li>  <li>power supply services, communication and information, transmission, monitoring and process control systems;</li>  <li>coal preparation techniques, oriented to the needs of the consumer markets;</li>  <li>coal conversion;</li>  <li>coal combustion.</li> </ul><p><strong>2. Health and safety in mines</strong></p><p>This objectives covers issues concerning mine safety, including gas control, ventilation and air-conditioning with a view to improving underground working conditions and occupational health and safety as well as environmental issues.</p><p><strong>3. Efficient protection of the environment and improvement of the use of coal as a clean energy source</strong></p><p>This objective aims at minimising the impact of mining operations and the use of coal in the European Union on the atmosphere, water and the surface within the framework of an integrated management strategy with respect to pollution. As the European coal industry is undergoing constant restructuring, the research shall also be geared towards minimising the environmental impact of underground mines destined for closure. This includes:</p><p>(a) a reduction in emissions from coal utilisation, including capture and storage of CO2,</p><p>(b) a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, in particular methane, from coal deposits;</p><p>(c) the return to the mine of mining waste, fly ash and desulphurisation products, accompanied, where relevant, by other forms of waste;</p><p>(d) the refurbishment of waste heaps and the industrial use of residues from coal production and consumption;</p><p>(e) the protection of water tables and the purification of mine drainage water;</p><p>(f) a reduction in the environmental impact of installations which mainly use EU coal and lignite;</p><p>(g) the protection of surface installations against the effects of subsidence in the short and long term.</p><p><strong>4. Management of external dependence on energy supply</strong></p><p>The objective covers prospects for long-term energy supply and concerns the upgrading, in economic, energy-related and environmental terms, of coal deposits which cannot be extracted economically by conventional mining techniques. Projects may include studies, the definition of strategies, fundamental and applied research and the testing of innovative techniques which offer prospects for the upgrading of EU coal resources. This includes the integration of complementary techniques such as the adsorption of methane or carbon dioxide, coal bed methane extraction and underground coal gasification.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding</span></strong><br />\r\n    All specific rules for participation and submission of proposals under this call, including the rules for funding and the information on countries entitled to apply for financial assistance, are described in Chapter 2 of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2015_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2015 (volume I)</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in Section 5.1 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2015_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2015 (volume I)</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation </span></strong><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</span></strong> described in Section 5.2&nbsp;of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2015_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2015 (volume I)</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> described in Section 4.7&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/guide/calls/rfcs-call-infopack2015_en.pdf\">RFCS Information Package 2015 (volume I)</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    Information on the outcome of the evaluation: maximum 6 months from the submission deadline.<br />\r\n    Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal templates and evaluation forms for the types of action under this topic:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/pt/rfcs-call-pt-2015_en.pdf\">Proposal template (for all types of action)</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-rpj-2015_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for Research&nbsp;projects&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-pdp-2015_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for&nbsp;Pilot and Demonstration projects</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/rfcs/tpl/ef/rfcs-call-ef-am-2015_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for Accompanying Measures projects</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Model Grant Agreement (MGA)</span></strong><br />\r\n    A&nbsp;new MGA&nbsp;has been adopted in August 2015 by the Commission and will be used for granting financial aid to successful proposals submitted&nbsp;under the call RFCS-2015.&nbsp;The final text of the&nbsp;new MGA is&nbsp;available <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/pdf/rfcs/rfcs_mga-multi.pdf\">here</a>. <br />\r\n    Differences with the draft version of the MGA,&nbsp;previously published on this page, are&nbsp;limited to Annex 2a&nbsp;(in this annex, the formula for the calculation&nbsp;of unit&nbsp;costs has been removed;
