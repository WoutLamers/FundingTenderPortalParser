Education,</p><p>training, youth and sport can make a major contribution to help tackle socio-economic changes, the key challenges that</p><p>Europe will be facing until the end of the decade and to support the implementation of the European policy agenda for</p><p>growth, jobs, equity and social inclusion.</p><p>Fighting high levels of unemployment - particularly among young people - is one of the most urgent tasks for European</p><p>governments. Too many young people leave school prematurely running a high risk of being unemployed and socially</p><p>marginalised. The same risk threatens many adults with low skills. Technologies are changing the way in which society</p><p>operates, and there is a need to ensure the best use is made of them. EU businesses need to become more competitive</p><p>through talent and innovation.</p><p>Europe needs more cohesive and inclusive societies which allow citizens to play an active role in democratic life. Education,</p><p>training, youth work and sport are key to promote common European values, foster social integration, enhance intercultural</p><p>understanding and a sense of belonging to a community, and to prevent violent radicalisation. Erasmus+ is an effective</p><p>instrument to promote the inclusion of people with disadvantaged backgrounds, including newly arrived migrants.</p><p>Another challenge relates to the development of social capital among young people, the empowerment of young people</p><p>and their ability to participate actively in society, in line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty to \"encourage the</p><p>participation of young people in democratic life in Europe\". This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning</p><p>activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. Moreover,</p><p>there is a need to provide youth organisations and youth workers with training and cooperation opportunities, to develop</p><p>their professionalism and the European dimension of youth work.</p><p>Well-performing education and training systems and youth policies provide people with the skills required by the labour</p><p>market and the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfilment. Reforms in</p><p>education, training and youth can strengthen progress towards these goals, on the basis of a shared vision between policy</p><p>makers and stakeholders, sound evidence and cooperation across different fields and levels.</p><p>The Erasmus+ Programme is designed to support Programme Countries' efforts to efficiently use the potential of Europe\u2019s</p><p>talent and social assets in a lifelong learning perspective, linking support to formal, non-formal and informal learning</p><p>throughout the education, training and youth fields. The Programme also enhances the opportunities for cooperation and</p><p>mobility with Partner Countries, notably in the fields of higher education and youth.</p><p>In accordance with one of the new elements introduced in the Lisbon Treaty, Erasmus+ also supports activities aiming at</p><p>developing the European dimension in sport, by promoting cooperation between bodies responsible for sports. The</p><p>Programme promotes the creation and development of European networks, providing opportunities for cooperation among</p><p>stakeholders and the exchange and transfer of knowledge and know-how in different areas relating to sport and physical</p><p>activity. This reinforced cooperation will notably have positive effects in developing the potential of Europe\u2019s human capital</p><p>by helping reduce the social and economic costs of physical inactivity.</p><p>The Programme supports actions, cooperation and tools consistent with the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and its</p><p>flagship initiatives, such as Youth on the Move and the Agenda for new skills and jobs. The Programme also contributes to</p><p>achieve the objectives of the Education and Training Strategic Framework for European cooperation in Education and</p><p>Training and of the European Youth Strategy through the Open Methods of Coordination.</p><p>This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a</p><p>whole by contributing to growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 20, 2020 2:01:39 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 20, 2020 2:01:39 PM", "content": "<p><i><span style=\"font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;color:#1F497D;&#10;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">As a result of the difficulties by applicants due to the COVID-19 outbreak, we have extended the deadline for the Collaborative partnerships,&nbsp; Small collaborative partnerships and Not-for-profit European sports events.&nbsp; The new deadline is <b><u>21 April 2020 at 5pm</u></b></span></i></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 2, 2020 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 2, 2020 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-SCP-2020(EPLUS), EPP-SNCESE-2020(EPLUS), EPP-SSCP-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 6, 2019 8:10:45 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 6, 2019 8:10:45 AM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>Please note that calls with the following references EAC-A02-2019-CBY, EAC-A02-2019-JMO, EAC-A02-2019-JMD, EAC-A02-2019-SSA, EAC-A02-2019-SPO, EAC-A02-2019-KA are covered by the general call with reference EAC-A02-2019.</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 14, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 14, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-KA-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 7, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 7, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-CBHE-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 5, 2019 8:17:33 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 5, 2019 8:17:33 AM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: EPP-JMD-MOB-2020(EPLUS)</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:47 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:47 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-JMD-MOB-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:35 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:35 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-JMO-CoE-2020(EPLUS), EPP-JMO-SUPPA-2020(EPLUS), EPP-JMO-MODULE-2020(EPLUS), EPP-JMO-NETWORK-2020(EPLUS), EPP-JMO-PROJECT-2020(EPLUS), EPP-JMO-CHAIR-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:31 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:31 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-SSA-2020(EPLUS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:17 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 5, 2019 12:30:17 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EPP-CBY-2020(EPLUS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
