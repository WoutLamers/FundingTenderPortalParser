The importance of solidarity among individuals and communities, within or across borders, has become even more apparent with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting big inflow of refugees into the EU, frequent occurrences of extreme weather events (e.g. floods and forest fires) as well as recent large-scale seismic events in certain countries.</p><p>FOSTERING POSITIVE LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND OUTCOMES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>The Corps can provide significant value by assisting children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds or otherwise vulnerable groups with the attainment of adequate learning achievements.

It offers an inspiring and empowering experience for young people who want to help, learn and develop and provides a single entry point for such solidarity activities throughout the Union and beyond.</p><p>The Programme opens more and better opportunities covering a broad range of areas, such as integration of migrants, environmental challenges, prevention of natural disasters, education and youth activities, preservation of cultural heritage, humanitarian aid. It also supports national and local actors, in their efforts to cope with different societal challenges and crises.</p><p>By extending its scope to cover volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations, the European Solidarity Corps provides needs-based emergency aid and helps to deliver assistance, relief, and protection where most needed. It thus helps addressing not only unmet societal needs in Europe but also humanitarian challenges in third countries. </p><p>The activities of the European Solidarity Corps support the objectives of the EU Youth Strategy for 2019-20273 which encourages young people to become active citizens, agents of solidarity and positive change for communities across Europe, inspired by EU values and a European identity. The European Solidarity Corps also contribute to fulfilling the objectives of the Horizon Europe Missions, which tackle some of the greatest challenges facing our societies: improving the lives of people affected by cancer, adapting to climate change, restoring our ocean and waters, restoring soil health, and living in climate neutral and smart cities.</p><p>The European Solidarity Corps builds on the achievements of more than 25 years of European programmes in the field of youth and solidarity, especially on the success of the European Voluntary Service, on the EU Aid Volunteers initiative and on the previous European Solidarity Corps running from 2018 to 2020.</p><p>The general objective of the Programme is to enhance the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities, primarily volunteering, as a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity, democracy, European identity and active citizenship in the Union and beyond, addressing societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on the promotion of sustainable development, social inclusion and equal opportunities. </p><p>The specific objective of the Programme is to provide young people, including young people with fewer opportunities, with easily accessible opportunities for engagement in solidarity activities that induce positive societal changes in the Union and beyond, while improving and properly validating their competences, as well as facilitating their continuous engagement as active citizens. </p><p>In the context of the European Solidarity Corps, volunteering is a full-time (at least 30 and not more than 38 hours per week) unpaid activity that has a duration of up to 12 months.</p><p>This type of solidarity activity is undertaken through participating organisations that offer young people the opportunity to carry out a wide variety of activities, in a structured way. The scope of volunteering projects is broad, covering a wide range of areas, such as environmental protection, climate change mitigation or greater social inclusion.</p><p>In order to achieve its objectives, the European Solidarity Corps implements four Actions structured into two strands: </p><p>\u25aa Participation of young people in solidarity activities: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Volunteering Projects; </li><li>Volunteering Teams in High Priority Areas; </li><li>Solidarity Projects. </li> </ul><p>\u25aa Participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (\u201cVolunteering under the European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps\u201d): </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects. </li> </ul><p>Additionally, the European Solidarity Corps supports a series of activities and measures aiming at providing high-quality solidarity activities.</p><p>\u25aa Quality and Support measures</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>networking activities for individuals and organisations participating in the European Solidarity Corps;</li><li>appropriate measures to provide clearance requirements in accordance with applicable national law;</li><li>measures taken before, during or after the solidarity activities that aim to ensure the quality and accessibility of volunteering, including online and offline training, adapted, where appropriate, to the solidarity activity in question and its context, language support, insurance, including accident and sickness insurance, the further use of Youthpass, which identifies and documents the competences acquired by participants during the solidarity activities, capacity building, and administrative support for participating organisations;</li><li>the development and maintenance of a Quality Label;</li><li>the activities of European Solidarity Corps Resource Centres to support and raise the quality of the implementation of the Programme actions and enhance the validation of their outcomes; and</li><li>the establishment, maintenance and updating of an accessible European Solidarity Corps Portal and of other relevant online services, as well as necessary IT support systems and web-based tools.</li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 25, 2024 4:05:28 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 25, 2024 4:05:28 PM", "content": "<p>A presentation on the call and how to submit proposals in the Funding &amp; Tender Portal has been published on the EACEA website and it is available <a href=\"https://www.eacea.ec.europa.eu/news-events/news/2024-call-proposal-volunteering-teams-high-priority-areas-2024-01-25_en\" target=\"_blank\">at this link</a></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 7, 2023 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 7, 2023 12:00:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ESC-SOLID-2024-VTHPA(ESC-SOLID-UN)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
