The EU Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to build, strengthen, and interconnect, across the European Union, Security Operation Centres (SOCs) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities (monitoring, detection and analysis), with the aim to support the detection and prevention of cyber threats and the provision of timely warnings to authorities and all relevant stakeholders. Such cyber security capabilities are typically ensured by SOCs in combination with Computer Emergency Response Teams / Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs), with the support of external, specialised sources of intelligence on cyber threats. To implement this strategy, the previous DIGITAL work programme (2021-2022) included actions concerning Capacity Building of SOCs. This work programme aims at strengthening EU actions by supporting the creation of National SOCs, and networking them at European and EU level via Cross Border SOC platforms and coordinating their activities to create a stronger SOC ecosystem, also comprising of local and regional, private and public security centres for both horizontal and vertical sectors. These SOC platforms, that will be equipped with state-of-the-art digital technologies and tools to be continuously kept up to date, should in particular enable the exchange and analysis of data on cybersecurity threats from various sources, on a large-scale and in a trusted environment. The objective will be to support joint actions to create an advanced (state-of-the-art) threat detection and cyber early warning ecosystem. This will allow to reinforce capacities through the coordination of actions on collective knowledge and data sources, bringing together data from multiple sources and expanding cybersecurity threat intelligence. By fostering common and interoperable infrastructures, this will make it possible to more efficiently and more rapidly share and correlate the signals detected, thus enabling a better situational awareness and a more rapid and effective reaction of the relevant actors. The actions in this WP are focussed along three strands. \u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level. \u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms. \u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.</p><p>\u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level.</p><p>\u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms.</p><p>\u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.
