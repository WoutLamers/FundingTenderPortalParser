It supports HPC training programs to align with the needs of the HPC industry and research community and meet high quality standards.</li><li>Cooperation and exchange between education and training providers across Europe, by enabling the sharing of best practices, resources, and expertise, and foster innovation in teaching and learning. Overall, a more dynamic and competitive HPC education and training environment is established, which will benefit learners, educators, and employers alike.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective</SPAN>:<p>Central objective of the action is to establish the EuroHPC Academy covering the multidisciplinary field of HPC, including related areas such as emerging technologies (e. g. quantum computing), and its cross-cutting dimension. The Academy should significantly contribute to the development of coordinated HPC education programmes addressing a wide range of stakeholders, including academic education programmes, professional training, short-term courses, individual and independent learning. The action will ensure the availability of common quality and qualification standards in HPC, the compatibility of training modules and learning objectives as well as the uptake of standardisation of training and education in the European HPC ecosystem. Based on a skill tree identifying HPC key competences in a systematic and structured approach, the action will significantly improve the quality and availability of HPC training for European HPC users. A broadly recognised certification scheme for HPC competences in combination with high quality didactically consistent content, including exercises and assessments, will encourage also individual and independent learning. Overall, the Academy will significantly contribute to a more knowledgeable HPC workforce driving innovation and competitiveness in the European economy.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The activities of the EuroHPC Academy will be centred around several action pillars. The pillars represent key strategic components and work together to achieve the objectives of the virtual academy.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Competence and qualification framework (CQF)</li><li>Reference course material for the modular CQF</li><li>Assessment and certification scheme</li><li>Technical infrastructure</li> </ol><p>The EuroHPC Academy will support training providers with the implementation of HPC education, training, qualifications and assessments. It will provide structured material, exercises and assessments linked to a certification scheme which will incentivise also individual and independent learning. Central for the widest possible adoption of services are cooperation activities with the relevant stakeholders and communities including, but not limited to, Hosting Entities of EuroHPC supercomputers and EuroHPC initiatives such as the network of National Competence Centres for HPC (EUROCC 2, CASTIEL 2), the European MSc programme for HPC (EUMaster4HPC) and the European skills platform (HPC SPECTRA). As the EuroHPC Academy will exercise authority over the modular HPC curriculum, learning objectives and qualification standard, the consortium will establish close cooperations and effective feedback loops. Specifically with higher education institutions cooperations are of outstanding importance to ensure alignment and compatibility of the modular CQF with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). The CQF should allow training providers a maximum of freedom for the implementation according to the requirements of their target groups, while ensuring a common standard for the assessment of competences and the certification of qualifications.</p><p>The JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 6 million and a duration of 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting another duration or other amounts. Only one proposal will be selected.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the call document</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

One cardinal area is skills with the ambition to reach 20 million ICT specialists employed in the economy in 2030. The Digital Education Action Plan foresees several Actions including a European Digital Education Content Framework and a European Digital Skills Certificate.[[https://education.ec.europa.eu/focus-topics/digital-education/action-plan]] This is in line with other efforts for pan-European frameworks for skills and qualifications such as the European Qualifications Framework (EQF)[[https://europa.eu/europass/en/europass-tools/european-qualifications-framework]], that provides a common reference framework translating between national qualification systems, and ESCO, the European multilingual classification of Skills, Competences and Occupations[[https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/what-esco]].</p><p>Skills in the area of High Performance Computing (HPC) are critical and cross-cutting elements for many disciplines including the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and social sciences, but also for the development of innovative business models and advanced industrial products. Training a sustainable workforce with digital skills and knowledge in the area of HPC, addressing the specific needs of R&amp;D, business and advanced industrial HPC services is a major challenge to achieve these ambitions.</p><p>While many existing training and education offers rely on HPC, for example in academic STEM education programmes, action on the European level is required to develop a common basis for interdisciplinary HPC to support the adoption of education standards, mobility, the recognition of qualifications across countries and sectors as well as the uptake of advanced digital technologies in the Union. Significant coordination effort is needed to provide such a common basis for the development of syllabuses, curriculum guidelines, examinations and qualification standards across Europe to create a uniform training and education ecosystem. A pan-European standardised framework will support existing training programmes with a structured foundation of competences and qualifications to enable the development of a skilled, mobile, and competitive workforce in the Union.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Nov 7, 2023 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 7, 2023 12:00:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-EUROHPC-JU-2023-ACADEMY-02-01(DIGITAL-JU-CSA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
