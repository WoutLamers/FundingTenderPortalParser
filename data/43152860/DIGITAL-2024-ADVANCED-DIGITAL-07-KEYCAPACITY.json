Gains from major breakthroughs in key capacity digital technological areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, data analytics, virtual worlds, photonics, quantum, cloud and edge computing, and others) cannot materialise if there are not enough people with adequate knowledge to develop, deploy and use those digital technologies and their related applications. Evidence from the Structured Dialogue on digital education and skills with Member States shows that a majority of Member States expressed concerns about the shortage of ICT specialists<sup>1</sup>. Even in Member States that are digital frontrunners, there is a persistent shortage of people able to develop and deploy key digital technologies<sup>2</sup>. There also is a significant increase in the demand for professionals combining sectoral knowledge with digital skills enabling the use of digital solutions for specific business cases. This is for example the case of employees in the manufacturing sector able to use augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) tools to repair engines remotely, software developers and engineers with specific automotive expertise, or professionals in industrial sectors that are key to the green transition who are increasingly relying on advanced digital technologies in the development of renewable energy or clean and smart mobility solutions. These profiles can be referred to as users of advanced digital technologies and they are crucial to enable and support the digitalisation of traditional industrial sectors from agriculture and finance to manufacturing, automotive and medicine, and are key to achieve the twin green and digital transition.</p><p>Looking at the related education offer, the 2022 JRC report shows that the offer of specialised education programme in AI, cybersecurity, HPC and data science has slightly improved in the EU 27, in particular in AI, where the number of Master programmes has increased by 20% compared to the previous year. However, it remains lower than in the United States. For cybersecurity the United Kingdom alone continue to offer as many programmes as all EU Member States together<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The actions in the skills pillar therefore aim at tackling this challenge, while triggering a new way of delivering these programmes, building partnerships between academia, businesses and research across the EU.</p><p><sup>1 </sup><em>SWD (2023) 205 final: COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT accompanying the documents: Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the key enabling factors for successful digital education and training and Proposal for a Council Recommendation on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training {COM(2023) 205 final}</em></p><p><sup>2 </sup><em>For example, over 70% of enterprises looking for ICT specialists in the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg found it extremely difficult to recruit ICT specialists.

The call of 2023 built on the experience of the first work programme<sup>5</sup>, addressing the latest initiatives to support the development and deployment of key digital skills and capacities in digital technology areas, such as AI, data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, as well as other inter-, trans- or multi-disciplinary areas, and their applications in strategic sectors. The call of 2024 will support the development and deployment of key digital skills in selected digital areas: virtual worlds, edge computing, quantum computing, photonics, and robotics and automatization. The call will also support interdisciplinary programmes that will target the acquisition of advanced green digital skills (e.g. in the area of AI, data analytics, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, etc.) in selected strategic sectors: agriculture, transport, renewable energy, waste management, as well as the acquisition of advanced digital skills for government and public sector. In the selected digital areas and strategic sectors there is a high demand for ICT specialists (and is expected to further grow), but at the same time the offer of education programmes for these areas/sectors is limited, what will hinder their potential for economic uptake and growth. The call should also support possible cooperation in the context of ongoing international cooperation related to digital topics (e.g. digital partnerships, trade and technology councils, policy dialogues, Talent Growth Task Force), e.g. by supporting students from those countries with financial support (e.g. via scholarships, fee waivers, or others) to participate in the education programmes including promoting female students participation. The proposals should clearly identify one digital area or one strategic sector as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed. It is expected to fund at least the highest-ranking proposal from each above listed digital area or strategic sector providing that all thresholds are attain and within the limits of the budget available for this topic.</p><p>Projects financed under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and complementarities with actions on technology deployment supported by other pillars of the programme as well as links and synergies with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances, Erasmus+ Alliances for Innovation, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), the EIT Campus, the Deep Tech Talent Initiative and its possible follow-up initiatives, as well as the Large Scale Partnerships under the Pact for Skills.</p><p>The primary objective of this topic is to support the design and deliver a higher degree education programme(s) (at ISCED levels 6 (Bachelor's or equivalent level), 7 (Master's or equivalent level) or equivalent in 2023 and at ISCED levels 6, 7, 8 (doctoral or equivalent level) in 2024 - hereafter education programmes and to develop related self-standing modules, in selected key digital areas and for the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific strategic sectors. Besides the design and delivery of new educational programmes and self-standing modules, the selected projects can cover activities to attract qualified teaching staff, scholarships for students, the purchase or leasing costs for equipment, and different activities to establish partnership between academia, industry and research centers. The selected projects will also bring a clear EU added-value to the proposed education activities (such as cross-border collaborations, networks and exchange of ideas).</p><p><sup>4 </sup><em>Previous calls prioritised key digital areas were: Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Cybersecurity, Data, Extended reality, Internet of Things, Microelectronics, Photonics, Quantum, Robotics.</em></p><p><sup>5 </sup><em>List of selected projects from previous DIGITAL programme calls are and will be available on the Funding and Tenders portal (i.e. DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED and DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU).</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Deliverables:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Consortia of higher education institutions, research organisations and businesses and other stakeholders design and deliver education programmes and self-standing modules in the area of advanced digital skills for developers and users of advanced digital technologies.</li><li>Higher education institutions are upgraded with digital solutions, equipment and infrastructure, with a special focus on interoperability of IT systems.</li><li>Students are supported with scholarships (for participating in education programmes and internships), or via other financial and support measures.</li><li>Structural and sustainable partnerships between members of the consortium are established.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the call document</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The goal is to improve the capacity to nurture and attract digital talent, whilst fostering an ecosystem that will help drive innovation and digital breakthroughs. These actions contribute to reach the Digital decade target of 20 million ICT specialists employed in the economy in 2030, which include promoting the access of women to this field as well as increasing the number of ICT graduates and are in alignment with the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027)120. They can also contribute, where applicable, to the Deep Tech Talent Initiative121, one of the flagship initiatives under the New European Innovation Agenda122 and complement the two proposals for a Council Recommendation on digital education and skills adopted in April 2023. Strategic Objective 4 will focus on the following main work strands in this WP: \u2022 Building excellent consortia delivering specialised and inclusive education programmes (ranging from Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s to doctoral programmes or equivalent) focusing on key emerging technologies, increasing synergies and complementarities with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances and the Large Scale Partnerships (LSPs) under the Pact for Skills, in particular the Digital Ecosystem Partnership, as well as their focus on the digital transformation, also by ensuring interoperability between the participating organisations. \u2022 Actions will also boost the number of education and training opportunities for \u201cusers of advanced digital technologies\u201d, who are professionals in specific sectors, but also proficient users of digital technologies and/or multipliers, e.g. advisors in certain sectors. These are for example medical doctors that can use artificial intelligence (AI) in order to improve diagnostics techniques or architects able to harness the potential of extended and virtual reality for their construction projects or enhance their production processes, farm advisors exploiting the potential of precision farming technologies or software experts with specific automotive expertise. \u2022 Developing summer schools, boot camps and other activities, such as specialised career days to attract a wider audience to digital careers, whereas specific activities for raising awareness targeting pupils from the youngest age onwards, from all socioeconomic backgrounds, and in particular girls, will be key. These will need to be delivered in partnerships by higher education institutions, vocational education and training providers or research centres with organisations that are active in promoting digital and coding skills, as well as attracting girls and women to digital careers. \u2022 Providing insights into the gender gap in the ICT professions in the EU, collecting information on the gender gap in ICT professions in other countries internationally, identifying and analysing best practices to tackle it, providing a set of recommendations on activities needed to fight the gender gap in ICT professions in EU as well as creating a network of expertise and community of stakeholders to boost female participation in ICT across Europe. \u2022 Actions under this specific objective will be supported by the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform by offering promotion and dissemination activities, giving visibility to the actions and ensuring that they reach the relevant stakeholders. The Digital Skills and Jobs Platform will support collaboration among the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition and the digital skills community in Europe. The participation is open to all eligible entities as established by Article 18 of the Digital Europe programme, in particular public sector as well as private sector organizations including SMEs, higher education institutions and NGOs.
