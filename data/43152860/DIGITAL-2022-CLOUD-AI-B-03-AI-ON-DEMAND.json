Activities shall build on results from the preparatory action, as well as previous relevant projects such as the AI-on-demand platform and the European Language Grid initiated under Horizon 2020. In addition, the platform should mobilise the European innovators to provide their products and services on the platform. The platform should become the reference for any user (industry or public service), a one-stop-shop to access AI tools to integrate into solutions, products, and services: a common good and market place for AI resources.</p><p>It will implement mechanisms defined in the preparatory action and further cooperate with the corresponding actions running in parallel to interconnect with the cloud-to-edge infrastructure, HPC resources, the data spaces, and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) \u2013 providing the TEFs with relevant AI and related resources, and hosting the results once validated in the TEFs, as applicable.</p><p>The platform will play the role of a central marketplace for AI tools, and a service layer providing support to users (incl. public administrations) for integration of AI solutions. In addition, it will bring the latest AI tools and solutions to the level of industrial standard requirements (code validation, quality check), connect to computing resources (e.g. HPC, cloud from this programme), data resources (e.g. data spaces from this programme, also datasets for training and validation), promote trustworthy AI development and deployment, facilitate the implementation of public procurement in AI, as well as raise awareness about best practices and success stories of AI applications in various domains. The AI-on-demand platform will also develop use-cases factory/library to support its activity. Specific attention will be given on guaranteeing that the resources on the platform respect the ethics guidelines issued by the High Level Expert Group on AI and the European AI Alliance and support the regulatory framework.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2022/call-fiche_digital-2022-cloud-ai-b-03_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a>.</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The EU data strategy outlined the importance of building a thriving ecosystem of private actors to generate economic and societal value from data, while preserving high privacy, security, safety and ethical standards. It announced that the Commission will invest in a High Impact Project that will fund infrastructures, data-sharing tools, architectures and governance mechanisms for thriving data-sharing and Artificial Intelligence ecosystems.</p><p>To reach these objectives, three main interlinked work strands are foreseen in the first two years of implementation of the Digital Europe Programme:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The deployment of <strong>cloud-to-edge infrastructure</strong> <strong>and services</strong> compliant with EU rules, notably on security, data protection and privacy and environmental aspects. Open-source by default, they will ensure fluid data flows. Completing the picture, the deployment of the Testing and Experimentation Facility for edge-AI will support the green transition with support to advanced low-power computing technologies. Such facility should be a role model in showing effective ways to comply with existing legislation, and taking into account relevant codes of conduct and guidelines.</li><li>The deployment of a<strong> </strong>Data for EU<strong> </strong>strand with a focus on building <strong>common data spaces</strong>, based on the above federated cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services that are accessible to businesses and the public sector across the EU. The objective is the creation of data infrastructure with tailored governance mechanisms that will enable secure and cross-border access to key datasets in the targeted thematic areas. Focus will be on data spaces for Green deal, smart communities, mobility, manufacturing, agriculture, cultural heritage, health, media, skills, language technologies, financial sector, public administrations and tourism. Data spaces will be supported by a Data Space Support Centre in order to guarantee coordination between the various initiatives and guarantee that data could be accessed across different sectors. The centre will ensure the best use of the cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services to serve the needs of these data spaces.</li><li>The deployment of<strong> AI reference testing and experimentation facilities</strong> with a focus on four prioritized application sectors (i.e. health, smart communities, manufacturing, and agriculture) (see also the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review\">Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review</a>). These facilities will provide common, highly specialised resources to be shared at European level. In addition, the <strong>AI-on-demand platform</strong> will be consolidated as a catalogue of AI-based resources and marketplace, for trustworthy AI tools made in Europe for both private and public sector use.</li> </ul><p>The participation is open to all eligible entities as established by Article 18 of the Digital Europe Programme, in particular public sector as well as private sector organisations including SMEs and NGOs.</p><p>All topics under this section are subject to the provisions of Article 12(6) of the Digital Europe Programme Regulation. The topics under Specific Objective 2 are closely interconnected within each area of intervention (for example, individual Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) benefit from common AI tools) as well as between the three intervention areas (for example, Artificial Intelligence is closely linked to the EU data and cloud initiatives, while the data spaces will provide a major source of data for AI-based applications and development as well as links to critical infrastructures, which must operate securely). These links require that the approach towards Article 12(6) must be systematic, i.e. it must take into account not only situations where given action is sensitive from the perspective of the security interest of the Union in itself, but also when it can affect the sensitivity of other actions.</p><p><em>Indicative budget</em></p><p>The budget for the topic included in this call is 28.000.000\u20ac</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 10, 2023 4:54:39 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 10, 2023 4:54:39 PM", "content": "<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-IE\">For information on the evaluation results of this call, please consult the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/99173\">Flash call info</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jun 8, 2023 9:49:51 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 8, 2023 9:49:51 AM", "content": "<p>Please note that you can access the details for the info session of this call in this link: <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/events/info-session-deployment-ai-demand-platform \" target=\"_blank\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/events/info-session-deployment-ai-demand-platform</a>.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "May 25, 2023 12:00:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "May 25, 2023 12:00:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-2022-CLOUD-AI-B-03-AI-ON-DEMAND(DIGITAL-CSA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
