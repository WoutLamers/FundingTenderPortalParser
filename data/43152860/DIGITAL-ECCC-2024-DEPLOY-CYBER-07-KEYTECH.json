Furthermore, they may enable new possibilities to protect data security and privacy.</p><p>The objective is to enable European cybersecurity actors to take advantage of these new breakthroughs, improving detection and prevention capabilities, efficiency, scalability, and facilitating data sharing and regulatory compliance.</p><p>In particular innovative technologies should allow for the processing of larger amounts of data, automating real-time pattern recognition, log analysis, vulnerability scanning, while enabling security professionals to focus on higher level interpretation of data and response decisions. They should allow organisations to deploy solutions and larger scale, and in increasingly complex environments.</p><p>A priority is to create and strengthen capacity for original Cyber Threat Information (CTI), e.g., in the form of CTI feeds or services.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Activities should fortify cybersecurity capabilities using breakthrough technologies, encompassing various aspects of cybersecurity. This involves uptake and integration for the deployment of novel tools, systems and services for threat detection, incident response, malware defence, vulnerability management, data protection and so forth. In one or more of the following topics should be addressed:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Real-time Monitoring and Incident Response: ensuring the swift identification and response to security incidents through continuous network monitoring, alert generation, and automated response mechanisms.</li><li>Malware Defence and Analysis: mitigating malware threats by analysing code behaviour, scrutinizing network traffic, and assessing file characteristics, thereby reducing opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Proactive Vulnerability Management: identifying and addressing weaknesses proactively through automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to address potential threats before they can be exploited.</li><li>Data Protection and Anomaly Detection: safeguarding sensitive data by scrutinizing access patterns and identifying abnormal behaviour to mitigate data breaches and protect critical information.</li><li>Incident investigation to help uncover cause, scope and impact of security incidents or breaches that have occurred.</li><li>Data Utilisation with Privacy: enabling organisations to harness data for analysis and insights while preserving data security and privacy through techniques such as anonymisation and de-identification.</li> </ul><p>By addressing such issues, the cybersecurity resilience of organisations should be enhanced, improving overall cybersecurity posture, encompassing various aspects such as threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management.</p><p>In well justified cases, access requests to the EuroHPC high performance computing infrastructure could be granted.</p><p>The systems, tools and services developed under this topic, where relevant, will be made available for licencing to National and/or Cross-Border SOC platforms under favourable market conditions.</p><p>This action aims at the deployment of key technologies in cybersecurity, in particular also in the context of securing national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. As this involves the handling of cyber incidents, malware and management of vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors, the deployment of such technologies must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to these technologies are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2024/call-fiche_digital-eccc-2024-deploy-cyber-07_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The EU Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to build, strengthen, and interconnect, across the European Union, Security Operation Centres (SOCs) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities (monitoring, detection and analysis), with the aim to support the detection and prevention of cyber threats and the provision of timely warnings to authorities and all relevant stakeholders. Such cyber security capabilities are typically ensured by SOCs in combination with Computer Emergency Response Teams / Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs), with the support of external, specialised sources of intelligence on cyber threats. To implement this strategy, the previous DIGITAL work programme (2021-2022) included actions concerning Capacity Building of SOCs. This work programme aims at strengthening EU actions by supporting the creation of National SOCs, and networking them at European and EU level via Cross Border SOC platforms and coordinating their activities to create a stronger SOC ecosystem, also comprising of local and regional, private and public security centres for both horizontal and vertical sectors. These SOC platforms, that will be equipped with state-of-the-art digital technologies and tools to be continuously kept up to date, should in particular enable the exchange and analysis of data on cybersecurity threats from various sources, on a large-scale and in a trusted environment. The objective will be to support joint actions to create an advanced (state-of-the-art) threat detection and cyber early warning ecosystem. This will allow to reinforce capacities through the coordination of actions on collective knowledge and data sources, bringing together data from multiple sources and expanding cybersecurity threat intelligence. By fostering common and interoperable infrastructures, this will make it possible to more efficiently and more rapidly share and correlate the signals detected, thus enabling a better situational awareness and a more rapid and effective reaction of the relevant actors. The actions in this WP are focussed along three strands. \u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level. \u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms. \u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.</p><p>\u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level.</p><p>\u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms.</p><p>\u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.
