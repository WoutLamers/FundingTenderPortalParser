The sharing of private and public data will provide a basis for applications and new services that will contribute to achieving the objectives of the EU Data Strategy, the Green Deal and the Common Agricultural Policy. The objective is also to support the initiative taking into account the potential creation of a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The scope includes establishing and implementing an operational data space dedicated to sharing agricultural data. This endeavour encompasses deploying the data space, alongside instituting governance and business models for its operation. Engagement with the community is pivotal, ensuring alignment with European, national, and local initiatives, as well as with other sectoral data spaces. This initiative will also need to continuously monitor the data space in view of gauging its 56 effectiveness and relevance. The awarded proposal(s) will use, in so far as possible and when available, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl.65 It will also work in close partnership with the Data Spaces Support Centre deployed under the first WP in order to ensure alignment with the rest of the ecosystem of data spaces implemented with the support of Digital Europe Programme, in particular in view of a data spaces reference architecture; common building blocks, toolboxes and standards; and data governance models. Right from the outset, the awarded proposal(s) is/are expected to work towards achieving financial sustainability by the conclusion of the action and consider relevant actions in this respect. 66 The project will need to take into consideration the work and recommendations of the preparatory action for the data space in agriculture and interoperability actions supported by the Digital Europe programme67 as well as of the Horizon Europe Partnership Agriculture of Data. The active participation of data providers and users from the project's inception is highly recommended since it will ensure that the data space is designed and structured to meet their needs, making the data space more relevant and leading to increased adoption rates and a stronger sense of ownership of data providers and users by the end of the project\u2019s runtime.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2024/call-fiche_digital-2024-cloud-data-ai-06_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2024/call-fiche_digital-2024-cloud-data-ai-06_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The data spaces bring together data, data infrastructures and governance structures in order to facilitate secure data pooling and data sharing, a pre-condition for wider availability of data across the economy and society. The data spaces aim to integrate data, data infrastructures, and governance structures with the purpose of facilitating secure pooling and sharing of data. This is essential for making data more widely accessible across the economy and society. The goal is to ensure fair access to data while adhering to EU regulations and values, enabling cross-border services and fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders. It is important for the data spaces to be scalable and encourage broad participation, while also striving to be interoperable with national solutions whenever feasible and available.</p><p>To enhance economies of scale, develop ecosystems across sectors and secure the European data value chain, data spaces should use, in so far as possible and when available, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl .</p><p>Under the WP 2021-2022, the basis was laid for the development of 12 data spaces in line with the European data strategy. The work on the data spaces is accompanied by a review of the policy and legislative framework for data access and use, with the Data Governance Act40 and the Data Act,41 as well as the Implementing Act on High-value datasets42 under the Open data directive43 adopted on 22 December 2022. To ensure the continuation of the work, this WP will provide funding for:</p><p>\u2022 further development of individual data spaces,</p><p>\u2022 the development of the common platform for European open data covering datasets from EU, national, local, regional and geo portals,</p><p>\u2022 a new action on Digital Product Passport.</p><p>Services based on data available through data spaces will become more and more essential for the proper functioning of critical infrastructures. Any interruption on the access to data would cause disruptions and affect security or public safety.</p><p>Given that the data spaces will also provide a major source of data for AI-based applications and development, their integrity and security is essential also for the secure and proper functioning of systems aiming to process and exploit such data, including data analytics and AI systems.</p><p>It is expected in general that data spaces will be subject to a number of risks that should be addressed. Notably, the risk of malicious action by individuals, groups or regimes that would attempt to compromise, distort or disclose data in the data infrastructures, thus compromising the availability of the service and the integrity of the information/data used for/within that service. The addition of unsecure elements by unauthorised users can undermine the security features of other elements. Moreover, data spaces will be combined, aggregated, recomposed and in many cases software defined working on top of common or overlapping infrastructures. If such data spaces do not provide the same level of reassurance from the outset, the combined data will always lead to the lowest common denominator for security, which will weaken the trust that organisations have in those data spaces. Furthermore, the exploitation and use of the data will often require access to several data spaces, and the interlinking of access infrastructure will make the whole dataspace ecosystem even more reliant on a common high level of security.</p><p>In this context, the security risks should not be assessed separately sector by sector (or data space by data space) but at a more general and systemic level. Some data spaces will be using common infrastructures and tools, which means that security risks for one data space would also affect the others. In addition, the utility that can be extracted from data (but also the risk related to abuse) increases exponentially when data from different sources and sectors are combined.</p><p>As a consequence, some of the data spaces will be subject to the provisions of the Article 12(6) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/694 on the specific grounds of public order and inner stability, protection of data privacy and fight against fraudulent and deceptive practices. The reasoning is twofold:</p><p>\u2022 First, there is a need to have trustworthy operators developing and running these data spaces so they can be protected from malicious attacks and be trusted by private and public stakeholders to entrust their data. </p><p>\u2022 Second, these topics will create an ecosystem of trust aiming to facilitate the reuse and take up of the data covered, and thus economic growth. Having different and separate security conditions for the abovementioned data spaces, and/or dividing each thematic data space into more and less sensitive sections, with different operators and levels of interconnection, would damage the ecosystem of trust as well as the desired take up with its positive economic consequences, implying higher transaction and interoperability costs and discourage, in particular, SMEs</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:00:07 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:00:07 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-COMPETENCE(DIGITAL-SIMPLE), DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-GENOME(DIGITAL-CSA), DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-AGRISPACE(DIGITAL-SIMPLE)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
