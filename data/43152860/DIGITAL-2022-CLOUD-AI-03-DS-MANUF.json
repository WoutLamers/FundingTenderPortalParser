The solutions must be characterized by a high degree of user-orientation in terms of trustworthiness, data sovereignty of the companies and manageability. Particularly SMEs will benefit from larger sets of industrial data to broaden their offers in terms of products and services, with the support of the European Digital Innovation Hubs.</p><p>Actions will address one of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Supply chain operations are more flexible, circular, effective and efficient, with reduced inventory levels, more timely deliveries between organisations, better resilience to interruptions of delivery channels, and reduced costs.</li><li>Maintenance operations are better timed, with reduced overall downtimes and maintenance costs, extended machine usage periods, new service models, and improved future machine designs.</li> </ul><p>As part of the actions addressing one of the expected outcomes above, the organisation(s) operating the data spaces will deliver good practices for data sharing agreements such as code of conduct and contract template enabling such a degree of trust that brings together a sizeable number of manufacturing companies.</p><p>Furthermore, stakeholders in these actions have to agree on approaches and ideas for circularity, on how to improve design, reuse, repair, remanufacturing, recycling, and environmental impact by data sharing and demonstrate benefits of the first generation of the product passports for all involved stakeholders as well as for sustainability. Interoperability of data within this data space will be designed such that cross-sectoral interoperability can be easily achieved in the future.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective</SPAN>:<p>Data sharing among manufacturing companies and with (service) providers will be increased by the deployment of two data spaces of the manufacturing industry, which will demonstrate how sharing industrial data improves company operations (1) across supply chains and (2) using deep industrial data within production environments, enhances business opportunities for industrial data value added services, and supports the transition towards a circular economy.</p><p>Manufacturing data spaces and their AI-based analytics and optimisation applications can influence company-internal processes as well as processes across organisations. On the basis of the preparatory actions, the main objective is to deploy two operational data spaces<strong> </strong>across value chains in the manufacturing sector, which enable companies in different user roles (e.g. supplier, client, service provider) to interact with large amounts of industrial data across their organisational borders. The first data space will address agile supply chain management and execution across a large set of supply chain stakeholders, and the second one dynamic asset management and predictive/prescriptive maintenance, unlocking deep industrial data for trustworthy and reliable value-added services by parties outside a production site, such as machine tool manufacturer and integrator, improving production line operations.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The action calls for the deployment of two operational data spaces of the manufacturing industry, building on the results of the preparatory actions. The projects should have sufficient activities to lead to sustainability at the end of the action, as identified in the preparatory actions mentioned above.</p><p>Such data spaces will offer a secure and trustworthy way of making data usable between supplier and user companies on the basis of voluntary agreements. Starting from existing \u2018embryonic\u2019 data spaces with manufacturing companies, their data sharing will be completed, deepened, expanded, and/or enlarged with other organisations (e.g. reuse, repairing, remanufacturing, refurbishing or recycling companies in order to improve circularity) and gradually integrated into the Data Space Technical Infrastructure. The data spaces for manufacturing must be operated and coordinated by companies, an industrial association or a non-profit organisation demonstrating their capacity to act as trustworthy data brokers and to continue operations beyond the end of the action.</p><p>The actions need to target one of these two specific complementary data spaces for manufacturing:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Performing agile supply chain management and execution by continuously monitoring and exchanging status data on e.g. purchase orders, sales orders, inventory levels, order progress, demand forecasts, raw materials, chemicals and energy use and supply, etc. across the value chain. End users are different tiers in a supply chain (suppliers, OEMs, and customers).</li><li>Carrying out dynamic asset management and predictive/prescriptive maintenance by continuously monitoring and exchanging data on machine status, breakdowns, downtimes, service orders, etc. End users are machine users, machine vendors, maintenance service providers, and remanufacturers.</li> </ul><p>In addition, the actions need to address the following mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Bringing together relevant stakeholders to industrial data agreement(s) on design, reuse, recycling, and environmental impact and indicators for continuous monitoring and exchange of data on product performance and reuse, material content and origin,, feedback to design, product recycling, product remanufacturing, etc. The work should demonstrate data-based sustainable business models and the benefits of data sharing for the organisations participating in the value chains.</li><li>Carrying out further actions needed to effectively track and report resource use (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>) from a manufacturer\u2019s perspective in going forward. Actions should preferably target data sharing for circularity in line with the Circular Economy Action plan (COM(2020) 98 final).</li> </ul><p>The actions for the deployment of these two data spaces for manufacturing will have to gradually make use and be in full compliance with the European Data Spaces Technical Framework. They can profit from and use the smart middleware platform and tools. They will also have to coordinate and collaborate with other projects participating in the deployment of the data space, the Data Spaces Support Centre and the governance body identified by the first phase in order to allow integration of existing standards and to ensure interoperability and portability across infrastructure, applications and data.</p><p>Furthermore, the actions implementing the Data Spaces for Manufacturing are encouraged to cooperate with the European Digital Innovation Hubs for a broad uptake by the industry as well as the Testing and Experimentation Facility for Manufacturing to define European test and training data sets and to provide support in their establishment.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2022/call-fiche_digital-2022-cloud-ai-03_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

Such facility should be a role model in showing effective ways to comply with existing legislation, and taking into account relevant codes of conduct and guidelines.</li><li>The deployment of a<strong> </strong>Data for EU<strong> </strong>strand with a focus on building <strong>common data spaces</strong>, based on the above federated cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services that are accessible to businesses and the public sector across the EU. The objective is the creation of data infrastructure with tailored governance mechanisms that will enable secure and cross-border access to key datasets in the targeted thematic areas. Focus will be on data spaces for Green deal, smart communities, mobility, manufacturing, agriculture, cultural heritage, health, media, skills, language technologies, financial sector, public administrations and tourism. Data spaces will be supported by a Data Space Support Centre in order to guarantee coordination between the various initiatives and guarantee that data could be accessed across different sectors. The centre will ensure the best use of the cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services to serve the needs of these data spaces.</li><li>The deployment of<strong> AI reference testing and experimentation facilities</strong> with a focus on four prioritized application sectors (i.e. health, smart communities, manufacturing, and agriculture) (see also the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence-2021-review\">Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review</a>). These facilities will provide common, highly specialised resources to be shared at European level. In addition, the <strong>AI-on-demand platform</strong> will be consolidated as a catalogue of AI-based resources and marketplace, for trustworthy AI tools made in Europe for both private and public sector use.</li> </ul><p>The participation is open to all eligible entities as established by Article 18 of the Digital Europe Programme, in particular public sector as well as private sector organisations including SMEs and NGOs.</p><p>All topics under this section are subject to the provisions of Article 12(6) of the Digital Europe Programme Regulation. The topics under Specific Objective 2 are closely interconnected within each area of intervention (for example, individual Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) benefit from common AI tools) as well as between the three intervention areas (for example, Artificial Intelligence is closely linked to the EU data and cloud initiatives, while the data spaces will provide a major source of data for AI-based applications and development as well as links to critical infrastructures, which must operate securely). These links require that the approach towards Article 12(6) must be systematic, i.e. it must take into account not only situations where given action is sensitive from the perspective of the security interest of the Union in itself, but also when it can affect the sensitivity of other actions.</p><p><em>Indicative budget </em></p><p>The budget for the topics included in this chapter is EUR 548 million, distributed as follows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>EUR 204 million for topics supporting the deployment of the cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services, including the Testing and Experimentation Facility for Edge-AI;</li><li>EUR 206 million for topics deploying the sectorial data spaces and the related support activities, including the High Value Data Sets;</li><li>EUR 139 million for topics implementing the sectorial Testing and Experimentation Facilities and the AI-on-demand platform.</li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "May 15, 2023 12:06:33 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 15, 2023 12:06:33 PM", "content": "<p><span class=\"ui-provider biy biz c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t bja bjb w x y z ab ac ae af ag ah ai aj ak\" dir=\"ltr\">For information on the evaluation results of this call please consult the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/flash-information-call-results-cloud-data-and-tef\" target=\"_blank\">Flash call info.</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt\"><i><span lang=\"EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 25, 2022 5:25:16 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 25, 2022 5:25:16 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:12.0pt\">&nbsp;NB: Please be aware&nbsp; that the budget table relating to this call has been modified <strong>ONLY for those topics where the cost category of Financial support to third parties is not an eligible cost</strong>.
