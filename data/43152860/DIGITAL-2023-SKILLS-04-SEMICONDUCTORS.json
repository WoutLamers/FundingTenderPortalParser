It is estimated that the BRIICS countries (including Indonesia) will produce three-quarters of the global STEM graduates by 2030 while Europe will be lagging well behind with an 8% share<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>. The shortage of potential employees with specific knowledge in semiconductors, and in particular the negligible share of students willing to undertake this field, has many different causes related to the low awareness of the impact of semiconductors in the society and citizens\u2019 daily life, and to low expectations in terms of prospective career and employment conditions. The problem is acute, given the gap between the labour market demands and the unavailability of both technicians and high-level graduates, and it is even more exacerbated by a strong gender imbalance.</p><p>The image of semiconductors related jobs needs to be improved in this regard with a holistic approach by industry and academia, jointly addressing:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The low awareness of the public, and particularly the younger generation, of the social importance of semiconductors and its benefits for the whole society, i.e., for the green and digital transition or the targets set by the Chips Act.</li><li>The awareness gap on future work commitments and employment conditions. It is well known that studies are greatly influenced by students\u2019 previous experience within the secondary school and in their private lives, which can hardly provide insight into this high-tech sector. Starting from the very first classes in secondary schools is of the greatest importance for targeting students interested to approach these disciplines, with particular focus on female students.</li><li>The obstacles faced by companies, in particular SMEs given their limited means, to get the required talents, by setting up initiatives to attract both technicians and graduates, and bridge the gap between education and their labour demands.</li><li>The need to provide updated academic curricula both in theoretical knowledge and lab experience on cutting edge topics - the high pace of advancements in the semiconductor sector forces upgrades that are difficult to implement by private and public universities, and liaison with industrial stakeholders is essential to access new technologies, launch educational opportunities and increase their attractiveness to students.</li><li>The need of continuing vocational training to enhance employability, supporting personal development and encouraging re- and up-skilling. Technicians must be provided with additional training during their lifelong careers to keep up to date with new technologies and techniques.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Consortia can apply for one or both the actions described below.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li><u>Academic network</u></li> </ol><p>The proposed project is required to develop a European Semiconductors Skills Academy: a European network of higher education institutions and relevant industries, including start-ups and SMEs in microelectronics, to address the above issues.</p><p>The Academy must strive for collective actions to increase the visibility and the attractiveness of existing curricula already run by the members of the consortium. In particular, focus should be on increasing the number of enrolled students coming from secondary schools and ensuring the availability, in higher education institutions\u2019 curricula, of topics addressing industry\u2019s needs as well as cutting-edge topics in the sector, for example Chip Design.</p><p>The Academy should address, for example:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the identification of relevant courses, jointly vetted with the industry partners, starting from existing curricula, or from newly selected cutting-edge topics, which should eventually lead to an automatic recognition of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) across universities, facilitating students\u2019 and workers\u2019 mobility and competence recognition across Member States;</li><li>the upgrade of university laboratories for the delivery of the courses identified;</li><li>cooperation agreements resulting in hands-on experiences in industry and financed by industry as part of the student curricula;</li><li>the involvement of start-ups and SMEs as beneficiaries of students\u2019 mobility;</li><li>communication actions and initiatives aimed at the general public as well as specific activities for the promotion of studies in semiconductors in local areas, particularly aimed at secondary school students.</li> </ul><ol style=\"list-style-type:upper-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li><u>Vocational training</u></li> </ol><p>The proposed project is requested to define a platform among Vocational and Educational Training (VET) centres, industry, in particular start-ups and SMEs, academia, and social partners to address the need of continuing vocational training to enhance employability.

They can also contribute, where applicable, to the Deep Tech Talent Initiative, one of the flagship initiatives under the New European Innovation Agenda and complement the two proposals for a Council Recommendation on digital education and skills to be published in April 2023.</p><p>Strategic Objective 4 will focus on the following main work strands in this WP:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Building excellent consortia focusing on key emerging technologies, increasing synergies with Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances and the Large Scale Partnerships (LSPs) under the Pact for Skills, in particular the Digital Ecosystem Partnership, as well as their focus on the digital transformation, also by ensuring full interoperability between the participating organisations.</li><li>Actions in 2023 will also boost the number of education and training opportunities for \u201cusers of advanced digital technologies\u201d, who are professionals in a specific sector, but also proficient users of digital technologies and/ or multipliers, e.g. advisors in a certain sectors. These are for example medical doctors that can use artificial intelligence (AI) in order to improve diagnostics techniques or architects able to harness the potential of extended and virtual reality for their construction projects or enhance their production processes, farm advisors exploiting the potential of precision farming technologies or software experts with specific automotive expertise.</li><li>Developing summer schools, bootcamps and other activities, such as specialised career days to attract a wider audience to digital careers, whereas specific activities for raising awareness targeting pupils from the youngest age onwards will be key.
