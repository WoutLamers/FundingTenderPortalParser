It will empower SOCs which are linked to National SOCs, and to a stronger collaboration between local SOCs, National SOCs and Cross-Border SOC platforms, leading to an increased data sharing and better detection capability for cyber threats. This should in particular foster interoperability, identifying what data can be shared, how this is shared and in what format, requirements and sharing agreements, and ways to enable better exchange. Links to the actions funded under the Cybersecurity Skills Academy (in the main Digital Europe work programme) can also be envisaged.</p><p>These actions should lead to increased engagement, including from the private sector, and to a better collaboration towards a common EU cyber threat knowledge base and technological independence.</p><p>Additionally, Cross-Border SOC Platforms will develop a comprehensive governance framework, with for example enrolment conditions and vetting procedures. The aim is to foster discussion between such platforms, sharing best practices and identifying opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>One Coordination and support action will be selected, bringing together the largest possible network of National and Cross-Border SOC platforms.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Actions should address one or more of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Activities and technical frameworks that foster the collaboration and interconnection between Cross-Border SOC platforms and National SOCs, as well as fostering the link between National SOCs and other SOCs at national level.</li><li>Actions that support the cooperation and coordination of Cross-Border SOC platforms, both between different Cross-Border SOC platforms, and with relation to national SOCs and other SOCs.</li><li>Actions to foster links between public sector and industry, and stimulate mutually beneficial exchange of information, tools and data as well as exchange of knowledge and training opportunities.</li><li>Actions to foster links between SOCs and industrial stakeholders in artificial intelligence and in other enabling technologies, fostering the adoption of such technologies, including AI techniques and tools rand facilitating getting acquainted with existing state of the art tools (such as for example those developed in Action 1.1.4 of this work programme) and knowledge exchange.</li><li>Actions to engage stakeholders from the HPC stakeholder community and practitioners of breakthrough AI technologies, to develop a blueprint for the requirements of AI models that necessitate access to large or smaller HPC facilities, and next steps to make this happen, as well as raising awareness of this in the wider SOC community.</li> </ul><p>These actions aim at creating or strengthening <em>national</em> and/or cross-border SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security <em>of</em> national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2024/call-fiche_digital-eccc-2024-deploy-cyber-07_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The EU Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to build, strengthen, and interconnect, across the European Union, Security Operation Centres (SOCs) and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities (monitoring, detection and analysis), with the aim to support the detection and prevention of cyber threats and the provision of timely warnings to authorities and all relevant stakeholders. Such cyber security capabilities are typically ensured by SOCs in combination with Computer Emergency Response Teams / Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs), with the support of external, specialised sources of intelligence on cyber threats. To implement this strategy, the previous DIGITAL work programme (2021-2022) included actions concerning Capacity Building of SOCs. This work programme aims at strengthening EU actions by supporting the creation of National SOCs, and networking them at European and EU level via Cross Border SOC platforms and coordinating their activities to create a stronger SOC ecosystem, also comprising of local and regional, private and public security centres for both horizontal and vertical sectors. These SOC platforms, that will be equipped with state-of-the-art digital technologies and tools to be continuously kept up to date, should in particular enable the exchange and analysis of data on cybersecurity threats from various sources, on a large-scale and in a trusted environment. The objective will be to support joint actions to create an advanced (state-of-the-art) threat detection and cyber early warning ecosystem. This will allow to reinforce capacities through the coordination of actions on collective knowledge and data sources, bringing together data from multiple sources and expanding cybersecurity threat intelligence. By fostering common and interoperable infrastructures, this will make it possible to more efficiently and more rapidly share and correlate the signals detected, thus enabling a better situational awareness and a more rapid and effective reaction of the relevant actors. The actions in this WP are focussed along three strands. \u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level. \u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms. \u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.</p><p>\u2022 Building and strengthening National SOCs, which will play a key role as a hub or gateway to other SOCs at national level.</p><p>\u2022 Capacity building for cross-border SOC platforms.</p><p>\u2022 Strengthening the SOC ecosystem with cross cutting actions and support for local, regional or vertical SOCs.
