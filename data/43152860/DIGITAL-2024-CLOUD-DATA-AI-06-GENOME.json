According to statements by Member States\u2019 representatives in 1+MG, establishing a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) to operate and maintain the European GDI is the preferred option for the sustainability of the initiative and data infrastructure. This action will support preparatory work for the creation and for the operation of an EDIC, facilitate strategic orientation of the 1+MG initiative and support expert work to enable the uptake of genomics for healthcare and public health purposes, as well as the data aspects of the 1+MG Framework.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The action will support Member States\u2019 work enabling creation and operation of an EDIC on genomics in line with the Decision (EU) 2022/2481 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 establishing the Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 and to prepare the future EDIC for playing a focal role in facilitating the uptake of genomics and the European genomic data infrastructure in the contexts of healthcare delivery and public health policy. The EDIC will play an essential role in the effort to ensure public trust in genomics, enable broad uptake by healthcare professionals, e.g. by enhancing digital skills and auxiliary data services, and to raise awareness among policymakers regarding the benefits of application and integration of genomics in healthcare systems\u2019 services and in public health policy measures. The EDIC will also need to define its relationship with the EHDS. Finally, the EDIC is expected to be involved in the implementation of data-related guidelines constituting the 1+MG Framework, in particular regarding (meta)data standards and data quality assurance. To this end the action is expected to: 77 The European Genomic Data Infrastructure will be deployed by the GDI project funded under the Digital Europe programme (project number 101081813, topic DIGITAL-2021-CLOUD-AI-01-FEI-DS-GENOMICS). 67 \u2022 support workshops, working groups, meetings with private and public stakeholders, necessary for creating the EDIC for the 1+MG initiative and supporting its implementation roadmap, \u2022 make analysis and proposals on the necessary legal and ethical enablers and arrangements specific to this EDIC, \u2022 map the gaps, challenges and unmet needs, and propose the respective actions for the EDIC, as necessary to establish the EDIC sustainability roadmap including legal, ethical, organisational and economic aspects, and covering implementation for research, healthcare and public health purposes, \u2022 explore the implications of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Regulation and operationalise the EDIC\u2019s participation in the HealthData@EU infrastructure, \u2022 establish the evidence base for the health impact and economic implications of genomics (costs/benefits) to inform the relevant health economic models and health policy decisions, \u2022 explore models for public-private partnerships for genomics in healthcare, \u2022 maintain and promote the use of the Maturity Level Model (MLM) developed by the \u201cBeyond 1 Million Genomes\u201d (B1MG) project to ensure coordinated alignment across healthcare systems towards implementation and equity in access to genomics medicine, \u2022 design actions to promote the literacy level and education of citizens, health professionals and policy makers on genomic medicine across Europe, \u2022 establish frameworks that are necessary to ensure that the data made available to users via 1+MG meet the agreed data standards and data quality requirements, including specific roles for the EDIC. This action should build on / align with the outcomes of the B1MG and GDI projects and goals of the Genome of Europe project, while clearly defining its distinct scope and deliverables. In particular, the data infrastructure developed and deployed by the GDI project and the respective data governance will form the cornerstone of the future EDIC. The action should also take into account and leverage the synergies with the future European Health Data Space and the respective preparatory projects (e.g. TEHDAS, HealthData@EU pilot).

The data spaces bring together data, data infrastructures and governance structures in order to facilitate secure data pooling and data sharing, a pre-condition for wider availability of data across the economy and society. The data spaces aim to integrate data, data infrastructures, and governance structures with the purpose of facilitating secure pooling and sharing of data. This is essential for making data more widely accessible across the economy and society. The goal is to ensure fair access to data while adhering to EU regulations and values, enabling cross-border services and fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders. It is important for the data spaces to be scalable and encourage broad participation, while also striving to be interoperable with national solutions whenever feasible and available.</p><p>To enhance economies of scale, develop ecosystems across sectors and secure the European data value chain, data spaces should use, in so far as possible and when available, the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl .</p><p>Under the WP 2021-2022, the basis was laid for the development of 12 data spaces in line with the European data strategy. The work on the data spaces is accompanied by a review of the policy and legislative framework for data access and use, with the Data Governance Act40 and the Data Act,41 as well as the Implementing Act on High-value datasets42 under the Open data directive43 adopted on 22 December 2022. To ensure the continuation of the work, this WP will provide funding for:</p><p>\u2022 further development of individual data spaces,</p><p>\u2022 the development of the common platform for European open data covering datasets from EU, national, local, regional and geo portals,</p><p>\u2022 a new action on Digital Product Passport.</p><p>Services based on data available through data spaces will become more and more essential for the proper functioning of critical infrastructures. Any interruption on the access to data would cause disruptions and affect security or public safety.</p><p>Given that the data spaces will also provide a major source of data for AI-based applications and development, their integrity and security is essential also for the secure and proper functioning of systems aiming to process and exploit such data, including data analytics and AI systems.</p><p>It is expected in general that data spaces will be subject to a number of risks that should be addressed. Notably, the risk of malicious action by individuals, groups or regimes that would attempt to compromise, distort or disclose data in the data infrastructures, thus compromising the availability of the service and the integrity of the information/data used for/within that service. The addition of unsecure elements by unauthorised users can undermine the security features of other elements. Moreover, data spaces will be combined, aggregated, recomposed and in many cases software defined working on top of common or overlapping infrastructures. If such data spaces do not provide the same level of reassurance from the outset, the combined data will always lead to the lowest common denominator for security, which will weaken the trust that organisations have in those data spaces. Furthermore, the exploitation and use of the data will often require access to several data spaces, and the interlinking of access infrastructure will make the whole dataspace ecosystem even more reliant on a common high level of security.</p><p>In this context, the security risks should not be assessed separately sector by sector (or data space by data space) but at a more general and systemic level. Some data spaces will be using common infrastructures and tools, which means that security risks for one data space would also affect the others. In addition, the utility that can be extracted from data (but also the risk related to abuse) increases exponentially when data from different sources and sectors are combined.</p><p>As a consequence, some of the data spaces will be subject to the provisions of the Article 12(6) of the Regulation (EU) 2021/694 on the specific grounds of public order and inner stability, protection of data privacy and fight against fraudulent and deceptive practices. The reasoning is twofold:</p><p>\u2022 First, there is a need to have trustworthy operators developing and running these data spaces so they can be protected from malicious attacks and be trusted by private and public stakeholders to entrust their data. </p><p>\u2022 Second, these topics will create an ecosystem of trust aiming to facilitate the reuse and take up of the data covered, and thus economic growth. Having different and separate security conditions for the abovementioned data spaces, and/or dividing each thematic data space into more and less sensitive sections, with different operators and levels of interconnection, would damage the ecosystem of trust as well as the desired take up with its positive economic consequences, implying higher transaction and interoperability costs and discourage, in particular, SMEs</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:00:07 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:00:07 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-COMPETENCE(DIGITAL-SIMPLE), DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-GENOME(DIGITAL-CSA), DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-06-AGRISPACE(DIGITAL-SIMPLE)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
