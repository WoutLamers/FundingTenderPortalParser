Previous WP supported the creation of an EU data space for smart communities (and its validation via pilots) and action 2.3.2 pioneers innovative services using \u2018Citiverse\u2019 technology. Under the WP 2021-22, the Commission has also launched procurement actions to support the development of a LDT toolbox in the EU. However, more effort is needed to create a pan-European ecosystem of digital twins that can connect and scale up towards a future \u201cEU CitiVerse\u201d. To achieve the approach is to support the development of open source LDT solutions based on common needs of EU cities and communities (both urban and rural), to connect them and to enrich them with additional innovative services. In order to address the different maturity level of cities and communities, this action will help (1) connect and further develop the already existing LDTs, (2) gain a critical mass of smart communities\u2019 data sets, as well as (3) deploy, test, and add more complex AI-based elements to the LDT toolbox, addressing the needs of digitally advanced smart communities.</p><p>These and future actions regarding LDTs are contributing to the effective implementation of a Multi Country Project (MCP) in the area of Connected Public Administration.</p><p>The action is divided in three objectives, each to be achieved through a separate work strand:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Objective 1: <strong>Technical inter-connection of existing LDTs:</strong> Connecting data platforms and LDTs from cities and communities that already have a LDT in place, in order to create an EU \u201cfederation\u201d of LDTs. Reinforced interoperability through the aggregation of LDTs at a larger scale (cross sectors, cross cities, and cross borders) will help to scale up the EU common data sets and open-source solutions. It will also facilitate the way for less advanced cities and communities who wish to join the existing EU LDT ecosystem.</li><li>Objective 2: <strong>Creation of LDTs based on common needs:</strong> Developing open-source pilots of LDTs services, based on shared needs of cities and communities that already have a local data platform and/or a LDT and want to expand them with new real-life use case services. These services should aim to improve decision-making processes and citizen interaction; reduce risks, costs and downtime; enhance resilience and sustainability of LDT platforms and enable new value creation.</li><li>Objective 3: <strong>Adding new complex AI-based tools to the LDTs toolbox</strong>: Complementing the EU LDT toolbox launched under WP2021-22 with additional complex AI-based and innovative services (e.g., for adaptable multi-sector considerations, advanced simulation and modelling approaches including bottom-up self-organised models). The AI services should be developed and tested within existing cities/communities and be transferable to other contexts.</li> </ul><p>These objectives will be implemented through three work strands by a single project that will provide cascading funding to the third parties through a single call.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The selected proposal will manage a community of projects selected by cascading funding mechanism. The work of these projects will be implemented through three main work strands:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Work strand 1: Connect existing LDTs at EU level and lay down the foundations of an EU LDT ecosystem. When connecting LDTs, and their related data sets, projects should align with the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl to achieve interoperability and make use of horizontal services available under the Digital Europe programme such as the Smart Communities dataspace blueprint, the EU data cloud infrastructure and the EU LDT toolbox.</li><li>Work strand 2: Launch new pilot LDT services based on common needs of cities and communities to enhance interoperability and collaboration. The services should be tested in real-life conditions and expand the EU LDT ecosystem by making use of and contributing to the development of the EU LDT toolbox catalogue. The pilots should include at least the following activities:</li> </ul><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\" level=\"0\">  <li>designing real life use cases based on open and interoperable data sets across sectors. The use of these data sets should follow requirements of the data space for smart cities and communities' blueprint;</li><li>building and deploying the pilot services on LDT platforms at city/community level with real use case data;</li><li>defining roadmaps for making available the LDT-based services on the EU LDT toolbox catalogue</li> </ol><ul level=\"0\"><li>Work strand 3: Add new complex AI-based components to the forthcoming EU LDT toolbox to address the needs of cities/communities:</li> </ul><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\" level=\"0\">  <li>Develop and deliver new AI-based services to create simulations, predictive models and forecast in a variety of sectors and use cases amongst which the New European Bauhaus, public services and communities\u2019 resilience;</li><li>Develop and deliver solutions for designing, optimising, and testing urban policies in dynamic complex environments with several interwoven sectors (e.g., traffic volume and pollution levels). AI classical optimization may be complemented with self-organised bottom-up solutions that will offer the necessary adaptability and robustness;</li><li>Develop and deliver new complex AI-based services related to citizen\u2019s engagement, with or without the use of eXtended Reality technology to address aspects of the New European Bauhaus initiative and implement a sustainable, democratic and citizen-centric CitiVerse.</li> </ol><p>To maximize the scale-up and reusability of the new services, these should be designed in such a way that they can be adopted by different maturity levels LDT architectures.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2024/call-fiche_digital-2024-cloud-data-ai-07_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

However, given the nature of AI as a general purpose technology and the ongoing efforts to address the risks it may pose for specific fundamental rights through the proposed AI Act, it is important to continue to build-up additional capacity towards world-class large-scale reference sites for testing and experimentation of AI-powered solutions that will foster the deployment of trustworthy, secure, transferable and scalable AI in Europe and to provide means for an effective implementation of the future EU Regulation on AI (the \u2018AI Act\u2019). This will also facilitate the respect of fundamental rights by minimising the risk of erroneous or biased AI assisted decisions. Many solutions prototyped or tested in labs have the potential to address the current needs for AI based solutions. However, they often cannot be deployed due to the lack of testing in real (or representative) environment as opposed to just virtual for proving the capability to efficiently address the needs of the users, or due to the lack of certification against relevant existing standards such as safety. In addition, market and post-market compliance assessment under the upcoming AI Act are basic elements that are not in place yet. The actions proposed are expected to address those issues and to play a key role in the implementation of the proposed regulatory framework for AI. TEFs will have strong connections and use data spaces as much as possible and will interact with parallel mechanisms as the AI-on-demand platform where relevant. Additionally, TEFs will naturally develop fruitful exchanges with EDIHs, as they are potential both providers and consumers of their services. On top of the current planned sectorial TEFs (Health, Manufacturing, Agri-Food, Smart Cities and Communities), the current WP introduces additional horizontal actions. In particular, a Coordination and support action will ensure that a cross-sector perspective can be applied to all existing and future TEFs that will complement the current ones and fill the gaps where a smart investment for the uptake of AI is needed. A special focus is given to AI in the healthcare sector and to language technologies including an open-source language foundation model. New actions are also introduced, aiming at supporting the preparation of the implementation of the future AI Act. Finally, two actions have focus on local communities, building on the smart communities\u2019 data infrastructure, developing the different layers of VR/AR worlds for communities and moving towards an ecosystem of networked Local Digital Twins across the EU.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 4, 2024 12:00:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 4, 2024 12:00:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-07-DIGITALTWIN(DIGITAL-GFS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": true, "allClosedTopics": false}}}
