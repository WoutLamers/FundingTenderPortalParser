This DPP information system should rely on international or European standards in the following areas: data carriers and unique identifiers, access rights management, Interoperability (technical, semantic, organisation) including data exchange protocols and formats, data storage, data processing (introduction, modification, update), data authentication, reliability, and integrity, data security and privacy. Where possible, this will consist in using the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl. The access to information included in the DPP should be role-dependent (i.e., differentiated by stakeholder type). The full interoperability of the same DPP information system among different supply chains should be one of the characteristics tested and proven by the pilot.</p><p>The pilot will build on the available results of the Coordination and support action (CIRPASS)as well as other relevant initiatives. It will also consider the appropriateness of the latest tracking and tracing technologies, internet of things systems, distributed ledger technologies, cybersecurity methods and cloud technologies and infrastructures (such as GAIA-X).</p><p>A specific contribution is expected on demonstrating at large scale the feasibility of acquiring, managing and securely sharing the data held or generated by operators such as supply chain actors, manufacturers, resellers, repairers, remanufacturers, and recyclers, along these value chains for which an access by other relevant stakeholders would have a major beneficial impact on circularity and sustainability.</p><p>The real-life deployment should validate and further improve protocols for secure and tailored access for the relevant stakeholders. It should test in real life setting open digital solutions for identification, tracking, mapping and sharing of product information along its life-cycle, ensuring interoperability across borders and a well-functioning EU Internal Market. This pilot will build on existing open international and European standards with the aim to provide for a consistent operational framework.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the call document</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.
