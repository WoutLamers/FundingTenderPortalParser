Healthcare technologies can help meet these demands by, among others, increasing effectiveness of treatment and diagnostic solutions and efficiency of health systems. The deployment of new medical digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) powered solutions for healthcare purposes requires access to real world health data. The amount of data available to drive the development of AI should be as large as possible to limit the introduction of biases that could undermine the effectiveness and safety of healthcare AI solutions or increase inequalities in access to care.</p><p>The European Health Data Space (EHDS) establishes a common framework for the reuse of health data. It aims to facilitate and streamline access to EU-wide real-world health data for specific purposes such as the development, testing, deployment and uptake of products or services contributing to public health or the training, testing and evaluation of algorithms, including in medical devices, AI systems and digital health applications. The proposal for a Regulation on the EHDS provides for Health Data Access Bodies (HDABs) in each country as trusted anchors to support and supervise the reuse of health data.</p><p>As part of the wider AI ecosystem in health, such as Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) for AI and European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), this action aims to strengthen the role and capabilities of HDABs in streamlining the testing and deployment pathways for healthcare AI solutions.</p><p>The aim of this action is also to reduce time-to-market and foster the development of new AI-based healthcare products and services that significantly improve patient safety and wellbeing, while preserving privacy and security. This action is not only relevant to the implementation of the EHDS, but also to the implementation of the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), which establishes an overarching framework for trustworthy AI, including in healthcare (e.g. medical devices).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Scope</strong></p><p>The action comprises the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Identifying current pathways, i.e. regulatory, organisational and technical processes and means, for the development, testing and deployment of AI in health, as well as limitations, bottlenecks and gaps reducing the overall effectiveness of these pathways; \u2022 Designing more effective pathways by leveraging EHDS and Health Data Access Bodies, and possibly Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) and European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs);</li><li>Creating and implementing the necessary capabilities at the level of the Health Data Access Bodies to support these pathways for the development, testing and deployment of AI in health, and building around them an appropriate community including where appropriate, data users, data holders, TEFs and EDIHs;</li><li>Testing and showcasing these pathways with Health Data Access Bodies and the relevant actors in the community, based on specific examples in relevant disease areas, e.g. cancer, mental health or cardiovascular diseases;</li><li>Providing guidelines and recommendations for improving the development, testing and deployment pathways for AI in health, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the EHDS.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the call document</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The EU Data Strategy outlined the importance of building a thriving ecosystem of private actors to generate economic and societal value from data, while preserving high privacy, security, safety and ethical standards. It announced that the Commission will invest in a High Impact Project that will fund infrastructures, data-sharing tools, architectures and governance mechanisms for thriving data-sharing, Artificial Intelligence ecosystems and the next generation of cloud and edge services. Specific Objective 2 has three main work strands:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Continuation of activities in the area of cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services with new topics foreseen.</li><li>The deployment of a Data for EU strand with a focus on deploying sectorial common data spaces, based on the above federated cloud-to-edge infrastructure and services that are accessible to businesses and the public sector across the EU that were initiated in the first WP.
