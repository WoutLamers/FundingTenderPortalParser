The vast majority of SMEs - 99% - do not own any patent, 91% do not own any registered trade mark, and only 0.7% own a registered design. Nine out of 10 SMEs do not own any of the above industrial property rights. Even fewer SMEs own EU-wide IP rights titles. This means that SMEs throughout the EU and throughout different sectors of economic activity are missing out on substantial growth and development opportunities. Although no cause-effect can be firmly established, SMEs that use IP generate 32% revenue more than their peers not using IP.</p><p>SMEs point out that they do not have the knowledge about and they do not see the benefits of intellectual property. An individual advice service that looks at all the products and services of the SME and its future business strategy to suggest a matching IP strategy is a response to this situation. Developed in some EU Member States, the IP pre-diagnostic or IP audit, is the exact tool that can help SMEs see the benefits of IP in their individual context and show them a how they can integrate IP in their business strategy.</p><p>SMEs also face relatively high costs of the IP system, which includes not only the application/registration fees but also the costs of external legal advice. The advice and the specific competence of a patent attorney in drafting patent applications is a necessary step to ensure the protection sought that will match the needs of the SME.</p><p>The creation of the unitary patens is designed to offer major opportunities for SMEs to ensure cheaper EU-wide protection of their intellectual property. This will allow for an easier buy-in of the unitary patent system by SMEs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The present action intends to facilitate access for SMEs to an effective protection and enforcement of their intellectual property by informing them about the benefits of using IP rights and about the opportunities linked with this new unitary patent, and by reimbursing some of the associated cost of using the new unitary patent.</p><p>In order to maximise impact, this action will focus on highly innovative SMEs, such as, the holders of the Horizon 2020 Seal of Excellence (SoE), which are considered as companies with a particularly high potential for exploiting their intellectual property rights. In some Member States where Seal of Excellence companies are not numerous enough another method of selection of innovative companies may be used.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The activities to be carried out by the beneficiary<strong> have to cover all the six areas listed below</strong>.</p><p><strong>a) Setting up the Coordination Centre</strong></p><p><strong>b) Setting up the website </strong></p><p><strong>c) Publishing, coordinating and managing the calls for expression of interest</strong></p><p><strong>d) Action impact measurement</strong></p><p><strong>e) Management, quality control and evaluation </strong></p><p><strong>f) Reporting </strong></p><p>The Coordination Centre will be responsible for preparing and publishing nine calls for applications for SMEs to express interest in being offered IP pre-diagnostic services or being reimbursed for the received support actions.
