The university (ies)8 beneficiary of the grant will take care of managing travelling and accommodation of participants. The university (ies) will organise a conference at the end of the course, where the cohort would meet with best practitioners in public procurement in the EU.</p><p>The content of the action should include public procurement law and practical tendering processes, as well as strategic procurement and supply chain management, to ensure CPBs can benefit from private sector procurement efficiencies while maintaining compliance within public procurement legislation and guidelines.
