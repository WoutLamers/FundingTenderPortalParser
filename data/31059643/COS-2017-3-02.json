This approach combines two mutually reinforcing initiatives: </p><p>First, the Commission has set up Thematic Smart Specialisation Platforms to bring together <em>regional authorities</em> interested in joining forces in the implementation of their RIS3 strategies. This approach was launched in 2015 with the set-up of the Smart Specialisation Platform on Energy and two additional Thematic Platforms on Industrial Modernisation and on Agri-Food in 2016, with possibly others to follow.</p><p>Second, the Commission is starting with this call for proposals to mobilise European Strategic Cluster Partnerships for smart specialisation investments. These partnerships should be composed of cluster organisations, other business network organisations, technology centres and science parks aiming to boost inter-regional collaborations and innovation activities amongst groups of SMEs in specific thematic areas, related industries and value chains. Moreover, the strategic partnering of cluster organisations is not left to happen at random but with a specific linkage to the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Industrial Modernisation.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The European Strategic Cluster Partnerships for smart specialisation investments shall contribute to:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li> <p>developing and implementing a joint cluster partnership strategy with a common \u201cEuropean\u201d vision for a given specific smart specialisation priority (including a joint branding and marketing), identifying collaboration and investment opportunities and drafting a roadmap of such joint activities;</p> </li><li> <p>implementing joint activities with a view to mobilise inter-regional collaboration and investments of industry actors, notably SMEs, and provide related business, technology and growth support services for the preparation and implementation of joint innovation and investments projects; and</p> </li><li> <p>improving the cluster-specific framework conditions in the partners\u2019 regions by (a) identifying, preparing and testing new joint activities to strengthen cluster cooperation across the partnership; (b) gathering concrete feedback from SMEs on their specific barriers to innovation, skills, cooperation and investment (notably to feed into the discussions in the context of the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Industrial Modernisation); and (c) undertaking activities to build linkages with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives and key networks aiming to address such barriers.</p> </li> </ol><p>Most impact is expected from interregional collaboration if a dual approach is followed by involving both committed regional authorities (in charge of the implementation of smart specialisation strategies for research and innovation investments under the European Structural and Investment Funds) as well as the industry (mobilised via specialised SME intermediaries such as cluster organisations, business networks, technology centres and science parks). Therefore, this call aims to complement the mobilisation of interregional RIS3 partnerships of regional authorities under the Smart Specialisation Platform for Industrial Modernisation by generating corresponding partnerships of specialised SME intermediaries, and vice versa.</p>\n", "conditions": "<div>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</div>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: #003366\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding:</strong></span> Described in section 6 of the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/wp-call/cosme-call-cos-clustpartns-20170302_en.pdf\">Call document</a><u>.</u>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #339966\"><br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n    </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> Described in sections&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;6 of the <u><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/wp-call/cosme-call-cos-clustpartns-20170302_en.pdf\">Call document</a>.</u> <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.1. <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold: </span></strong>Described in section 9 of the <u><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/wp-call/cosme-call-cos-clustpartns-20170302_en.pdf\">Call document</a></u>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.2. <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">For submission and evaluation process,&nbsp;</span></strong>see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/guide/pse/cosme-guide-applicants-16_en.pdf\">Guide for applicants</a>. <span style=\"color: #339966\"><br />\r\n    <br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n    </span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: #003366\"><strong>Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement: </strong></span>described in section 3 of the <u><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/wp-call/cosme-call-cos-clustpartns-20170302_en.pdf\">Call document</a></u>. <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: #339966\"><br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n    </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>COSME Grant Agreement (COS-GA):</u><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/tpl/pt/cosme-pt-clustpartns-20170302_en.pdf\">Standard proposal template </a><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/mga/cosme-mga-multi_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement - Multi-Beneficiary</a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Additional documents:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/24803\">COSME Work Programme 2017</a><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013R1287\">COSME legal basis</a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/cosme/mga/cosme-mga-mono_en.pdf\"><br />\r\n    </a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nMembers of consortium are required to conclude a consortium agreement, in principle prior to the signature of the grant agreement.", "supportInfo": "<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\"><strong>Participant Portal FAQ</strong> </a>&ndash; Submission of proposals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/api/contact/index.html\">IT Helpdesk</a></strong> &ndash; contact the IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/index_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a> - Please use the manual with caution and only for the Participant Portal tools guidance</strong>, i.e. Submission service and Beneficiary register, because it is H2020 specific and does not cover the COSME rules.
