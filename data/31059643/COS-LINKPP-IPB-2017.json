Subsequently, the facilitator would engage the \"sources of innovation\" (i.e. start-ups, innovative SMEs) through its network and asked them to provide solutions for the identified need. A small number of those solutions would receive funding to develop their competitive ideas to a proof of concept that the enterprises could pitch to the buyers for potential procurement at a later stage.</p><p>The action would involve parties coming potentially from any EU MS. This new approach will be tested for further wider application at EU level.</p><p>There is also a clear focus on the promotion of SMEs and start-up companies, who could become involved through pilot projects to provide innovation through this programme.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 18, 2017 3:11:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 18, 2017 3:11:20 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-LINKPP-IPB-2017(COSME-GA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 18, 2017 11:04:43 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 18, 2017 11:04:43 AM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: COS-LINKPP-IPB-2017(COSME-GA)</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the deadline for this call has been extended until 4 January 2018.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 26, 2017 10:10:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 26, 2017 10:10:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-LINKPP-IPB-2017(COSME-GA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
