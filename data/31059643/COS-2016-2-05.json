The SMEs weight in above threshold procurement is still low when compared</p><p>with their contribution to GDP (only 45% compared to 58%). The participation of SMEs in</p><p>cross-border procurement is even lower.</p><p>The recent public procurement reform introduced specific legislative measures in this area,</p><p>including an encouragement to divide contracts into lots; the limitation of the turnover required</p><p>to participate in a tender procedure; and the reduction of documentation requirements. These</p><p>measures address several of the barriers SMEs face, but others, such as lack of knowledge</p><p>about the procedures, especially in other member States, limited tender skills and experience,</p><p>little dialogue with procurers, etc. remain. These issues are better tackled by support to the</p><p>SMEs directly.</p><p>The current action is designed to give support to SMEs through co-financing actions of</p><p>intermediate organisations supporting SMEs\u2019 participation in public procurement, especially</p><p>cross border. As a result, these organisations should offer more and better support. This</p><p>measure should complement the information on Your Europe Business and the efforts done by</p><p>the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) in this field and serve as a basis for a better</p><p>understanding of the SMEs\u2019 concrete needs and developing more precise tools. Furthermore,</p><p>certain tools developed under this project as well as the experience gained could be transferred</p><p>28</p><p>to the EEN for further dissemination to SMEs.</p><p>This action will be implemented through a call for proposals. As the needs of the SMEs vary</p><p>from country to country and from sector to sector, this measure will give flexibility to the</p><p>organisations submitting the proposal to tailor their services to their client needs. However, the</p><p>action could cover several measures such as exchange of information on procurement between</p><p>the Member States (tenders alerts and guides on what is specific to the respective country on</p><p>public procurement), training and advisory services to SMEs, business-to-procurers events,</p><p>partner-finding support, etc.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"calldescriptionkind\">Budget Information</SPAN>:<p>800 000 euros</p><p>Financing rate : 75%</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "May 20, 2016 3:12:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 20, 2016 3:12:47 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-2016-2-05(COSME-GA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
