The Communication stresses the need to support start-ups and promote adequate framework conditions and the right environment to ensure their scaling-up.</p><p>The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) contribute significantly to growth and jobs in the EU. They represent over 3 million companies employing 12 million people, with turnover of \u20ac 1.5 trillion. </p><p>CCIs also contribute to the development of new, innovative solutions to the challenges that companies and societies face. The increasing complexity of modern goods and services and their intertwining nature require inputs of highly-specialised knowledge. Combination of diverse skills and knowledge sources can be a source of competitive advantage for new business ventures and a driver of innovation. </p><p>Today innovation is as much about novel solutions that technology and design can provide as it is about understanding needs of society and ensuring wide participation in the process of innovation. In this context, creativity is seen a catalyst of an efficient conversion of scientific and technological knowledge into innovative products, services, and processes.</p><p>It appears that there is a need to accelerate and widen the exchange of skills of artists and creative people with entrepreneurs and technologists, thus creating a common language and understanding. The challenge is however that people and companies from different disciplines do not naturally cooperate with each other: although companies in creative industries are often very open to collaboration, they lack resources and interdisciplinary skills necessary to organise such collaborations. This is where incubators and other business support organisations can play a key role: they are equipped with adequate skills and infrastructure. </p><p>Moreover, the fusion of creativity with cutting-edge technologies creates disruption in many, often traditional industries (such as fashion and tourism) and leads to development of new business models and innovative concepts. </p><p>'FashionTech' is a clear example of such fusion. In this area, new products, services and solutions are being developed to address new consumer and societal needs (e.g. smart clothing for various applications, wearable devices and trackers or applications of new technologies to improve manufacturing and design processes or boost retail experiences).</p><p>This is also true for tourism, as exemplified by \"Welcome City Lab\" the incubator set up in 2013 and dedicated to tourism innovation in Paris France Tourisme Lab (\"r\u00e9seau fran\u00e7ais des incubateurs et acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateurs touristiques) set up in 2017 with the support of the French Ministry responsible for tourism or the start-up accelerator set up by Walt Disney Corporation.</p><p>Recognising the importance of tourism which employs 12 million people, the European Union is supporting innovation in this sector by complementing the action of the Member States, in particular to enhance its competitiveness (Title XXII Tourism, Art. 195). This objective was clearly underlined in the European Commission's Communication of 30 June 2010.</p><p>The European Commissioner responsible for tourism, Mrs Bienkowska, announced renewed efforts to develop synergies between CCIs and tourism. Such synergies are one of the objectives of COSME support for Business to Business matchmaking events for tourism operators. They are also pursued through grants for the promotion and development of transnational thematic tourism products linked to Cultural and Creative Industries. Other examples of support for CCIs-tourism synergies are given in the \"Guide on EU funding for the tourism sector (2014-2020)\".</p><p>Business incubators and accelerators in particular play a key role in the growth process of start-ups and SMEs. Studies show that the survival rate for incubated companies, after three years, is close to 90%, which is more than 20% higher than other companies. This is even more important for creative industries: the barriers to growth known to all entrepreneurs are often amplified in case of creative businesses. Moreover value chains of certain emerging industries are still scattered: it is therefore important to bring together relevant actors from across the EU to maximise the innovation potential and build much needed connections.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 14, 2017 4:13:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 14, 2017 4:13:03 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-2017-3-04-2(COSME-GA), COS-2017-3-04-1(COSME-GA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
