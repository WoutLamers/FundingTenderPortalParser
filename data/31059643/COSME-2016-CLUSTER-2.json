This 1<sup>st</sup> call has supported the establishment of up to 26 Partnerships (ESCP-4i) including 15 co-funded projects gathering about 150 cluster organisations across 23 European countries and reaching out to more than 17000 SMEs across Europe. The Partnerships are active in various industrial and cross-sectoral areas including health, aerospace, mobility and logistics, agrifood, energy, marine and environment, packaging, materials and photonics, ICT, construction and sports. The partnerships target cooperation with third countries' economies, of which the main ones include Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico and USA. This action further exploits synergies with other key initiatives of the Cluster Internationalisation Programme for SMEs that have been launched to promote transnational cluster cooperation within and beyond Europe with a view to better support SMEs in global competition.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"calldescriptionkind\">Budget Information</SPAN>:<p>The total budget earmarked for the co-financing of projects is estimated at EUR 400,000 for strand 1.b, and EUR 5,390,000 for strands 1.a and 2.</p><p>The maximum grant per project will be EUR 200,000 per project for strands 1.a and 1.b.
