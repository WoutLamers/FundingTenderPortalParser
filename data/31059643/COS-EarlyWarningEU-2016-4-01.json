It is essential to have modern laws and efficient procedures in place to help businesses, which have sufficient economic substance, to overcome financial difficulties and ensure that entrepreneurs get a \"second chance\".</p><p>Insolvencies are a fact of life in a dynamic, modern economy. Yet, insolvency frameworks in many EU countries continue channelling viable enterprises in financial difficulties towards liquidation rather than restructuring while experience shows that the earlier companies in difficulties are able to restructure, the higher their chance of succeeding. But early restructuring (before formal insolvency proceedings are started) is not yet provided for in several EU countries. Furthermore, long discharge periods and conditions for failed entrepreneurs are often so strict that bankruptcy effectively bars a failed entrepreneur from a quick second start and sometimes even results in a \"life sentence\" away from business.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"calldescriptionkind\">Budget Information</SPAN>:<p>The total budget earmarked for the co-financing of projects is estimated at EUR 3,800,000.00.</p><p> EASME expects to fund 1 (one) proposal.</p><p>The grant is limited to a maximum reimbursement rate of 75% of <strong>eligible costs.</strong></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 23, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 23, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-EarlyWarningEU-2016-4-01(COSME-GA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
