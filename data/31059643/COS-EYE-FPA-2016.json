These mobility actions aim to help the</p><p>entrepreneurs enrich their experiences as well as learn and network with entrepreneurs in</p><p>other participating countries. This measure will expand and strengthen the existing network of</p><p>Intermediary Organisations (IO) which act as local contact points in participating countries.</p><p>The IOs are in charge of recruiting and matching the entrepreneurs and facilitating the</p><p>mobility actions. They also promote the programme and its benefits at local and national</p><p>level.</p><p>Activities to support the network are carried out, including regular meetings with the IOs to</p><p>foster networking. A Support Office assists the Commission in the promotion, the</p><p>coordination of the IOs' network and the day-to-day support. This measure is a follow-up of</p><p>the preparatory action carried out in 2009-2011, under the EIP objective Entrepreneurship and</p><p>Innovation Culture in 2012 and 2013 and under COSME in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>The interim evaluation of the preparatory action confirmed the added value of this action and</p><p>the lack of similar schemes at national level. It also confirms the efficiency of the operational</p><p>set up to fulfil the pursued objectives and the quality of the exchanges carried out. The cross72</p><p>border nature of the action makes it unique as a way of promoting entrepreneurship and is</p><p>directly relevant to a key EU policy objective of internationalisation and helping new and</p><p>growing businesses to take advantage of the EU\u2019s Internal Market. Promotion of the benefits</p><p>and achievements of the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and technical support to users will</p><p>be provided.</p><p>The initiative will be implemented via Call for Proposals.</p><p>Entities can be public or private entities whose core activity is in the field of business support.</p><p>The rate of Union co-financing shall be up to 90 % of eligible costs incurred by the IOs. The</p><p>European Union contribution shall not exceed 75 % of the programme management costs but</p><p>may be up to 100 % of the sum allocated by beneficiaries (IOs) to third parties (sub-grantee.</p><p>i.e. new entrepreneurs) participating in a mobility action.</p><p>Financial assistance to new entrepreneurs participating in a mobility action shall take the form</p><p>of a scale of unit cost of maximum EUR 6 600 per entrepreneur.</p><p>Service contract awarded to the \u201cSupport Office\u201d which ensures coordination and coherence</p><p>of the activities and particularly supports the Intermediate Organisations in their work.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 9, 2016 3:45:04 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 9, 2016 3:45:04 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: COS-EYE-FPA-2016(COSME-FPA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
