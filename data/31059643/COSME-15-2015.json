The platform would aim at promoting the take-up of cross border e-commerce and at creating an environment that allows Small and Medium Enterprises to take part in the cross border e-commerce growth. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>E-commerce is a key driver for growth and jobs. However, while domestic e-commerce rates are growing in most of the EU Member States, cross-border e-commerce (i.e. buying or selling goods from or to another Member State) is not following the same pace. Amongst other barriers, retailers often refer to a lack of transparency in information about cross border delivery, the lack of inter-operability between the different operators typically involved and the excessive costs of low volume shipments. These problems make it difficult for e-retailers to offer to their final consumers a satisfying e-commerce experience. <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The purpose of this initiative is to improve the <strong>transparency of information </strong>on existing parcel delivery solutions particularly for cross-border delivery, and thus <strong>facilitate cross-border shipping</strong> through the creation of a web information platform <strong>presenting and comparing the different solutions available for parcel delivery</strong>.
