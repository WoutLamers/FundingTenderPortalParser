This action will implement project(s) at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors, (including audiovisual), through the use of innovative technologies. It will also foster innovative cross-sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and monetisation of culture and creativity.</p><p>Two calls will test out the concept on a pilot, experimental basis, under the current multiannual financial framework: </p><p>- The present Call </p><p>- A second Call for proposals to be published once the Work Programme 2020 is adopted.</p><p>Innovative technologies can build bridges among different cultural and creative sectors. The role of digital technologies for cultural and creative sector is at the heart of the Commission\u2019s #Digital4Culture strategy. That is the Commission's strategy coupling culture and digital, using the digital potential to empower the positive economic and societal effects of culture. </p><p>Digital production and distribution in the age of media convergence is one of the pillars of the strategy. The digital revolution enables the creation of new and innovative artistic creations, but also innovative ways of presenting cultural heritage. In the digital environment, convergence of media \u2013 in particular audiovisual \u2013 and content is profoundly affecting production and distribution models. By using digital tools (including data and algorithms), the production of culture and creative goods can find new forms of expression, enhance cultural experiences (e.g. in museums and art galleries) and bring about new forms of cooperation among artists and other actors. In turn, culture and the arts can bring in their creativity potential to enhance the innovative capacity of Europe, both for society and industry.</p><p>In the light of this, this action will implement project(s) at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors (including audiovisual), for instance through the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality. It will also foster innovative cross-sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and monetisation of culture and creativity, including cultural heritage. </p><p>Support will be given to projects:</p><p>a) featuring new forms of creation at the cross roads between different cultural and creative sectors, including the audiovisual sector, and through the use of innovative technologies, including virtual reality, </p><p>or </p><p>b) fostering innovative cross sectoral approaches and tools to facilitate access, distribution, promotion and/or monetisation of culture and creativity, including cultural heritage. </p><p>The focus should be on the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li> <p>problem solving approach and addressing challenges for the cultural and creative sectors;
