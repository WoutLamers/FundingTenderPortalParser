Most recent estimates suggest that 9.3% of Europeans are unable to keep their homes adequately warm.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> Following the recent surges in energy prices, the number of energy poor households overburdened by their energy costs is likely to be on the rise. These higher prices, combined with low incomes and poor energy efficiency of buildings and appliances, are root causes of energy poverty. In addition to its causal multidimensionality, the phenomenon cuts across different policy sectors beyond energy, such as health, housing and social policy, requiring coordinated, holistic efforts at all governance levels, and involving different sectoral actors. While increasing the uptake of building renovation measures can bring significant long-term benefits to energy poor households, energy efficiency measures at the household level and increased use of renewable energy are also key tools in addressing energy poverty and can lead to lower energy bills and improved living conditions.</p><p>The European Green Deal<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> sets out to ensure an energy transition that is socially just and inclusive. In accordance with the Fit for 55 package, and in particular the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, Member States shall implement energy efficiency improvement measures as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing. These households should be prioritised in the implementation of energy savings obligations, with the option of requiring obligated parties<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> to achieve a share of their energy savings obligation among vulnerable customers and to work together with local authorities to do so. In addition, the EED (recast) underlines the need to address the split incentive dilemma and remove barriers to energy efficiency measures in multi-owner properties. To ensure more coordinated action on energy poverty, an EC Recommendation on Energy Poverty and accompanying Staff Working Document further set out a series of measures and policies that can be adopted<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>.</p><p>In this context, efforts should focus on offering support to overcome barriers to the uptake of renovation measures in multi-apartment buildings requiring coordinated action amongst homeowners, as well as supporting relevant actors, including public authorities, in designing longer-term strategies and coordination frameworks to mitigate energy poverty at different governance levels, including dedicated financing schemes specifically addressing energy performance improvements for energy poor households. As obligated parties under energy efficiency obligation schemes have potentially at their disposal the necessary data and means to identify energy poverty and vulnerability among their customers, supporting the obligated parties is needed in order to spread such schemes across the EU.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Actions should contribute to actively alleviating energy poverty and build on the tools, indicators and resources of existing initiatives, such as the Energy Poverty Advisory Hub<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> or the energy poverty pillar of Covenant of Mayors<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup></p><p>The proposed action should cover maximum <strong><u>two</u></strong> of the following bullet points:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the renovation of private multi-apartment buildings with energy poor residents, with a special focus on reinforcing and adapting the governance and decision-making structures of building management and homeowners or tenants associations, tackling related regulatory framework barriers (e.g. property and/or rental laws), split incentives (where relevant), and setting up and coordinating relevant support services. The renovation actions supported should take into account the ability of residents to remain in their homes to avoid gentrification.</li><li>Support national authorities in their obligation to empower and protect energy poor households by implementing the relevant provisions of the EED (recast)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup>. <p>This support should help analyse the national policy mix, and combine and pull the different energy poverty-related provisions together to allow for the effective and coherent application of measures at the national level. In doing so, the action should also support relevant authorities to evaluate the impact of different implementation options, taking into account the specific national needs and context on energy poverty.</p> </li><li>Actions should facilitate the delivery of capacity-building for national, regional and/or local authorities and societal intermediaries, <strong>and</strong> support these actors in setting up long-term, cross-sectoral coordination structures<sup><a target=_self href=#fn9 id=r9>[9]</a></sup> to tackle energy poverty. Such structures could include setting up national energy poverty observatories<sup><a target=_self href=#fn10 id=r10>[10]</a></sup>. The actors involved are expected to represent all relevant sectors (e.g. energy, social, health, and housing) to ensure a holistic participatory approach to the alleviation of energy poverty in the long term and to improve social cohesion. This capacity-building should ultimately lead to the relevant actors co-designing and rolling out integrated interventions and support schemes for the benefit of energy poor households; however, it is not expected that such interventions or support schemes are delivered as part of the action.</li><li>Support obligated parties in setting up and testing schemes for energy efficiency improvement measures for the benefit of people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing under the energy efficiency obligation schemes of the EED (recast)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn11 id=r11>[11]</a></sup>, including, where applicable, working together with local authorities or municipalities, and/or relevant networks such as the Covenant of Mayors. It is expected that obligated parties, in particular, are either directly involved or their support is clearly demonstrated in the proposal.</li> </ul><p><em>For actions addressing building renovation actions without a clear focus on energy poor households, please refer to </em><em>LIFE-2024-CET-BETTERRENO</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>F</em><em>or actions addressing policy support without a focus on energy poverty, please refer to call topic </em><em>LIFE-2024-CET-POLICY.</em></p><p>The proposed actions should take into account multiple benefits from the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy measures for the different energy poor target groups, such as improved health, comfort, air quality, better social inclusion etc. Specific attention could be paid to particular groups which are more at risk of being affected by energy poverty or more susceptible to the adverse impacts of energy poverty, taking into account gender, where relevant.</p><p>The proposed actions should involve local authorities and intermediaries such as consumer or social organisations, energy companies, healthcare providers, homeowners or tenants associations, energy communities, as relevant.</p><p>Proposals should justify the need for the development of any tools, databases or platforms, considering their added value compared to existing ones.
