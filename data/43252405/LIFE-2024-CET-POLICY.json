The revisions make the policy framework for sustainable energy more stringent and ambitious. While the legislative framework offers a good amount of flexibility to Member States to design the policy measures according to their needs and framework conditions, accurate monitoring, projecting and evaluation are essential elements of implementation. Importantly, the legislation is strongly interrelated and needs to be implemented and reported in an integrated, consistent way, including through the updates and implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plans, and their biannual integrated progress reports. </p><p>With these challenges in mind, the topic aims to support the implementation of the main pieces of legislation in the field of sustainable energy, notably of the Energy Efficiency Directive (Scope A), the Renewable Energy Directive (Scope B) and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Scope C). </p><p>Under the call 2024, proposals are invited for the Scopes A, B and C, i.e. proposals for actions to support Member States in the implementation of: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the Energy Efficiency Directive (Scope A). </li><li>the Renewable Energy Directive (Scope B). </li><li>the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Scope C). </li> </ul><p>Proposals are expected to focus on <strong><u>one</u></strong> of the 3 scopes established below.
