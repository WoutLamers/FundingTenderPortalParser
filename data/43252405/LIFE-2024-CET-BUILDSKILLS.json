This effort needs to be sustained through the rollout of ambitious training and qualification interventions aligned with the EU Green Deal, the EU\u2019s 2030 climate objectives as well as the EU\u2019s long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p>The first objective of the topic (Scope A) is to increase the number of skilled building professionals at all levels of the building design, operation and maintenance value chain. The focus is on the skills needed to enable the Clean Energy Transition, in particular the EU Renovation Wave, the EU Solar Energy Strategy<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, the Communication on Digitalising the Energy System \u2013 EU action plan<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, as well as the implementation of the provisions on skills as part of revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), and Renewable Energy Directive (RED).<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup></p><p>The second objective of the topic (Scope B) is to create a thriving community of practitioners actively involved in upskilling activities for building professionals, which will support the large-scale roll-out of successful approaches across Europe.</p><p>The topic supports and goes beyond the Large-Scale Partnership for the construction ecosystem under the Pact for Skills, which plans to upskill and reskill overall at least 25% of the workforce of the construction industry in the next 5 years, to reach the target of 3 million workers<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, as well as the Renewable Energy skills Large-Scale partnership.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> In addition, the topic aims to leverage synergies with the initiatives on digital skills for the energy transition addressed in the framework of the Communication on Digitalising the Energy System.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should address only <strong><u>one</u> </strong>of the two scopes below. The scope addressed should be clearly specified in the proposal's introduction.</p><p><strong>Scope A - Upskilling and reskilling interventions enabling a decarbonised building stock and energy system integration</strong></p><p>Proposals under Scope A should develop, test, validate and prepare the deployment of new and/or the upgrade of existing training and qualification schemes for all types of professionals involved in the building value chain ('blue collars' and/or 'white collars' professionals), as well as for professionals active in other sectors than construction and buildings renovation. To ensure a successful deployment phase, the proposed training and qualification schemes should be tailored to the specificities of the national markets targeted; proposals should demonstrate a clear plan for deployment after project completion.</p><p>The main focus of proposals should be on Continuing Vocational Education and Training (or professional training) of professionals, i.e. after they have entered working life. This may include the retraining of professionals from other sectors with skills transferable to construction and building renovation. In addition to the above, proposals may also address other parts of education and training (e.g. initial education and training, higher education), provided this is justified based on needs detected in the countries targeted.</p><p>All professional profiles involved in the building value chain, can be validly addressed. Proposals should clearly justify the choice of the profile(s) and level(s) in the European Qualification Framework (EQF) targeted.</p><p>The proposed action should address <strong><u>one</u></strong> of the following thematic areas:</p><p>1. Skills development and deployment supporting the implementation of core provisions of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), covering one or several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>skills for carrying out building energy audits, including assessment and advice for preparing buildings to operate at low temperature and integrate heat pumps.</li><li>Skills for inspections, design, installation and optimisation of heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems, as well as hybridisation, digitalisation for smart home energy management and energy system integration.</li><li>skills to deliver building renovation passports.</li><li>skills enabling to leverage accessibility, fire safety, and/or seismic safety interventions for energy efficiency improvements.</li> </ul><p>2. Skills development and deployment supporting the decarbonisation of the building stock, covering one or several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>skills for delivering building deep renovation, including through modular and industrialised solutions; training professionals in a cross-trade manner to allow for integrated renovation works.</li><li>skills for new and existing nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs) and bridging the gap towards Zero Emission Buildings (ZEBs).</li><li>skills related to whole life carbon (via the assessment of Global Warming Potential), circular construction and resource efficiency, and leveraging the Level(s) framework.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup></li><li>digital skills supporting greater energy performance of buildings, in particular through an enhanced use of Building Information Modelling.</li><li>skills for upgrading the smartness of buildings for greater energy performance (based on the Smart Readiness Indicator), looking in particular at sensors, building controls and building management systems.</li> </ul><p>3. Skills development for solar energy deployment and energy system integration, covering one or several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>skills to increase the workforce of trained installers and maintenance staff, in particular for onsite solar systems; measures focusing on the identification of skills gaps in companies along the value chains combined with targeted trainings.</li><li>upskilling for energy systems related digitalisation to allow energy management in homes, buildings and energy communities, i.e. covering several buildings or larger areas and districts to facilitate system integration via electrification of buildings and transport, linking smart appliances, smart recharging with demand response and storage etc.</li> </ul><p>4. Skills development for heat pump deployment, covering only <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reskilling interventions for professionals from other sectors with skills transferable to the heat pump value chain, including via partnerships between industry and trade associations, trade unions and public bodies to identify and attract suitable profiles.</li><li>Upskilling of professionals, including to integrate heat pumps as part of building renovation projects and for integrated solutions (e.g. heat pumps and PV together, hybrid heating systems). In that context, applicants may establish or reinforce cooperation between trades and/or among national associations and other relevant stakeholders to develop, test, and disseminate widely agreed EU-wide content guidelines for specialised training programmes, and core training material replicable and adaptable to local contexts.</li> </ul><p>5. Development and delivery of innovative on-site training methods (especially for on-site workers/ craftspeople) as part of renovation projects, in cooperation with product manufacturers. Actions should focus on the skills needed to carry out deep renovation. The proposed methods should help address one of the main barriers to upskilling, i.e. the lack of time from companies and professionals to enrol in upskilling activities. The proposed training should ultimately facilitate the cooperation and understanding between different crafts and professions, and support a holistic vision of the building and of renovation works.</p><p>6. Skills development and deployment for the implementation and effective operation of integrated home renovation services (or one-stop-shops), providing coordinated and coherent responses to the needs of building owners at each step of their renovation journey: from technical and social diagnosis, technical offer, obtaining permits, finding qualified professionals, contracting of works, structuring and provision of finance (e.g. loans), facilitating access to available subsidies or other support schemes, to the monitoring of works and quality assurance.</p><p>Regardless of the thematic area addressed, proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>be tailored to the specificities of the national markets targeted and demonstrate their complementarity with and added value compared to already existing training and qualification schemes.</li><li>provide details on the actual scope and content of the training and qualification schemes to be developed/upgraded, i.e. professional profiles and levels in the European Qualification Framework targeted; details about the thematic coverage; duration of the training courses; involvement of stakeholders in the validation of the schemes\u2019 content; mechanisms for the validation of acquired competences, and future deployment prospects.</li><li>include activities ensuring the recognition (e.g. certification, skills passports, skills registries etc.) of trained and qualified professionals.</li><li>include train-the-trainer activities.</li><li>include a testing and validation phase for the new or upgraded qualification schemes developed; this testing and validation phase should take place during the project lifetime. It should take the form of training sessions for building professionals, during which participants will trial and test the draft qualification scheme, the curriculum, the training materials as well as the recognition mechanisms developed within the project. The testing and validation phase should involve a representative number of trainees, based on the size of the targeted sector(s) in the countries involved. After the training sessions, feedback collected from the trainees should be used to validate and/or further improve the qualification and training schemes developed within the action. Infrastructure costs for developing new or upgrading existing training facilities will not be considered eligible.</li><li>include activities to develop a strategy ensuring that the proposed schemes will be scaled up and sustained/rolled-out after the end of the project, linking to available sources of funding at national and EU level and pro-actively engaging national training providers and national qualification authorities.</li> </ul><p>Proposals are also expected to include activities to engage relevant institutions in the field of energy, climate, education, employment, social and industrial policies. Applicants should notably foresee activities to engage employers, trade unions as well as education and training providers in order to ensure that training programmes and curricula are labour market-relevant and proactively integrate emerging skills.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup></p><p>Proposals are expected to leverage the work developed within the European Construction Blueprint<sup><a target=_self href=#fn9 id=r9>[9]</a></sup> which focussed on vocational education and training primarily for \u2019blue-collar\u2019 professionals up to level 5 in the European Qualification Framework. The proposed activities are also expected to align with and support the Pact for Skills in Construction as part of the European Skills Agenda<sup><a target=_self href=#fn10 id=r10>[10]</a></sup>.</p><p>Proposals under Scope A <strong>may be submitted by a single applicant from a single eligible country</strong>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals submitted under Scope A requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>Scope B - BUILD UP Skills community of practice</strong></p><p>The BUILD UP Skills initiative has funded more than 90 projects involving 32 countries since its inception. These projects have developed and tested a whole range of solutions and tools for skills intelligence, skills development and skills uptake in the building value chain.</p><p>Proposals under Scope B are expected to develop an EU community of practitioners with proven experience in the development and promotion of sustainable energy skills for building professionals in EU Member States and LIFE associated countries.</p><p>The community of practice should build bridges both within the group of BUILD UP Skills projects (past, ongoing and new ones starting during the project), as well as with other related projects and initiatives.</p><p>The community should foster pan-European collaboration and dialogue on cross-cutting issues, build and deploy collective knowledge, support and roll-out capacity building, increase market recognition, encourage convergence towards best practices and contribute to the development of partnerships between key actors.</p><p>The work of the community is expected to be structured around several working groups that will exchange on specific topics and produce relevant deliverables. Working groups are expected to meet on a regular basis (online and/or onsite as appropriate). Topics to be addressed by the working groups should include, but are not limited to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Sectorial skills needs</strong>: e.g. circularity, digital skills, building smartness, heat pumps and innovative Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) technologies; skilled energy auditors, new generation of electricians etc.</li><li><strong>Skills recognition</strong>: mechanisms and approaches ensuring that trained and qualified professionals are recognised by the relevant public authorities and industries.</li><li><strong>Innovative training methods</strong>: reduce the constraints inherent to the training process and foster a better understanding between crafts and professions. Mapping of existing e-learning tools and possible interoperability.</li><li><strong>Demand side mechanisms:</strong> notably how public procurement can boost demand for sustainable energy skills in the construction sector.</li><li><strong>National skills roll-out:</strong> accelerate the large-scale roll-out of skills interventions.

This may notably target relevant players such as public authorities, energy agencies, training providers, companies active in the building value chain, social partners etc.</p><p>The community should also develop effective communication actions to showcase the most relevant best practices to policy makers and stakeholders at all governance level (EU, national, regional, local), and notably promote the national roadmaps developed by projects funded under calls LIFE-CET-2021 and LIFE-CET-2022.</p><p>The Commission intends to select one single proposal under Scope B.</p><p>Proposals submitted by a single applicant or proposals covering a single eligible country are not considered appropriate under scope B. The community of practice to be established must be transnational and actively involve a variety of stakeholders from various eligible countries. Therefore, the Commission considers relevant that consortia gather a <strong>minimum of 3 applicants from 3 different eligible countries</strong>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals submitted under Scope B requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts.
