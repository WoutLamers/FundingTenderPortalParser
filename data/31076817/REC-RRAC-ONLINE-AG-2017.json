P</u></strong><strong><u>riorities and activities to be funded</u></strong></p><p><strong>1.1. Priorities</strong></p><p>The Commission is committed to curb the trends of online hate speech in Europe. For that purpose, on 31<sup>st</sup> May 2016, the Commission agreed with the main IT Companies, on a Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online (<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1937_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1937_en.htm</a>). The call is thus aimed at supporting projects in the field of countering hate speech online, including projects aimed at contributing to better understand, monitor, prevent and counter hate speech online. A particular interest will be set on those projects contributing to the implementation of the Code of Conduct, including activities aimed at reducing the presence of hate speech online defined illegal according to EU and national law in social media platforms (Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA, of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law).</p><p>While proposals do not need to be transnational, the added value of projects involving organisations from more than one participating country is of particular interest.</p><p>The call for proposals to monitor, prevent and counter hate speech online will support:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>Projects aimed at understanding and countering hate speech online on social platforms/IT Companies: studies of how hate speech is spread on social media platforms, monitoring tools, data recording, analysis of trends and enhancing transparency (as a follow-up of the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online).</p> </li>  <li> <p>Projects aimed at building capacity of civil society on notifying hate speech online to IT Companies, including, but not limited to, to contribute to the implementation of the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online and training on the legal framework.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Projects on developing online balanced narratives and promoting the development of critical thinking by Internet users (as a follow-up of the 2016 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights).</p> </li>  <li> <p>Projects aiming at tackling online hate speech against journalists, collecting data related to online abuse against media actors and analysing its effects on the democratic debate (as a follow-up of the 2016 Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights).</p> </li> </ul><p><strong>1.2. Description of the activities </strong></p><p>In relation to the above mentioned priorities, the call will fund activities on:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Studies analysing the spreading of racists and xenophobic hate speech including the source and structures of groups generating and spreading such content, the volume and the frequency of content upload, the networks and networking activities, platform choices, as well as its reach-out to mainstream society and the appeal of racists and xenophobic material that incites to violence.</li>  <li>development of web tools countering hate speech online and supporting data collection. This will include setting-up of reporting systems recording complaints, data bases on take downs of illegal hate speech online, and data analysis of trends of hatred on the Internet.</li>  <li>dissemination and awareness raising activities, in particular: development of balanced narratives, media literacy activities aimed at enhancing critical thinking and awareness about accuracy of information, awareness raising of Internet users about reporting channels and tools..</li>  <li>mutual learning, exchange of good practices, including identifying best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries or organisations. Particular attention will be put to those projects containing activities aimed at enhancing synergies between organisations and helping building a network of organisations working on countering hate speech online across Europe. </li>  <li>capacity building and training activities. This includes activities aimed at training stakeholders on how to notify illegal content and monitor reactions of IT Companies as well as training activities on EU and national legal framework criminalising hate speech online.</li> </ul><p><strong>1.3. Expected results </strong></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>Contributing to better understanding how social media is used to recruit followers to the hate speech narrative and ideas.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Curbing increasing trends of illegal hate speech over the Internet;</p> </li>  <li> <p>Improving data recording and establishment of trends, including on the chilling effects of illegal hate speech online, particularly when addressed to key democracy players, such as journalists;</p> </li>  <li> <p>Strengthening cooperation between national authorities, civil society organisations and Internet companies, in the area of preventing and countering hate speech online;</p> </li>  <li> <p>Empowering civil society organisations in their activities countering hate speech online and in the development of balanced narratives;</p> </li>   <li> <p>Increasing awareness of the general public on online hate speech, including through increasing transparency and boosting public perception of the issue.</p> </li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>List of eligible countries<br />\r\n    </strong>The Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU), including their overseas departments,&nbsp;Iceland and Liechtenstein<br />\r\n    <strong>&nbsp;<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n    </strong></span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Eligibility&nbsp;and admissibility conditions</strong></span><br />\r\n    <strong><br />\r\n    </strong>2.1 Admissibility requirements are described under point 1 of part C of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/common/just-rec-guide-applicants-17_en.pdf\">Guide for applicants</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    2.2 Eligibility of the applicant and of the partners<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Applicants and co-applicants must be public entities or private organisations, duly established in one of the countries participating in the Programme, or international organisations.
