However, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.</p><p>Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission or referred to below (see bibliography). The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the award criterion<strong> \u2018a) relevance\u2019</strong>.</p><p>For projects in the area of violence against children, projects must take a rights-based approach and be clearly grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child (UNCRC). Applicants are required to include clear and explicit references to EU and international law and standards they will adhere to or be guided by in project design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring and explain the project rationale.</p><p>This call aims to fund <strong>targeted, practical projects ensuring maximum tangible and demonstrable benefits and impacts on the lives of beneficiaries. </strong>The projects should be practical projects rather than research and should include a combination of elements to form a coherent whole. All projects should not only develop a sound methodology using recognised existing good practice or tried and tested intervention models but consist of a large proportion of practical implementation measures and outcomes. These aspects will be taken into account when evaluating the quality of proposals. Applicants are invited to consider the weighting of the work streams, with a view to ensuring maximum practical benefits, positive outcomes and impacts for the target groups and the final beneficiaries, and to check that the management and coordination work streams (including travel) are not over-resourced. Activities such as the development of materials, <strong>the mapping of existing materials or research should be, at most, minor components of project proposals</strong>. If included, the need should be solidly justified in the proposal; they should lead to practical applications and interventions.</p><p>For <strong>priorities 1, 2, and 4</strong> applicants are, where appropriate and possible, encouraged to embed a<strong> \"behavioural\" approach </strong>(for further details please refer to \"Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making\", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): <a href=\"http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf\">http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf</a>)<strong> </strong>in their project, as a solution to the issues at stake often requires behavioural change. Behavioural sciences seek to understand how people make decisions in practice; how their behaviour is influenced by the context in which their decisions are made and how they are likely to respond to certain options. We welcome applications that clearly identify the behavioural element at stake (i.e. the factor(s) that has/have an impact on the target group's decision and behaviour).</p><p>Any <strong>training and/or practical tools should have an overarching objective to make the system work better to improve outcomes for the beneficiaries. </strong>This may include development and delivery of new training modules/tools or roll out and delivery of previously tried and tested training modules/tools. Proposals should describe how access to those to be trained will be assured and describe how training/tools will be rolled out in the participating countries. In terms of promoting sustainability, capacity-building should preferably focus on train-the-trainer approaches and may also include tools such as checklists/draft protocols, etc. For transnational projects, any training modules developed should be made available with a view to being replicated or adapted for reuse in other EU Member States. New training modules must be piloted and, if necessary, adapted prior to delivery.</p><p>All projects for each of the priorities under this call can be <strong>either national or transnational</strong> and should be elaborated in close partnership with and/or be led by appropriate key players, such as child protection agencies, police, health services, the judiciary, victim support organisations, helplines, refugee and asylum seeker services, social workers, etc. Applicants must document that they have the prior commitment of participating key players. Good quality cooperation among partners will be instrumental in making innovative projects successful. Regardless of whether projects are national or transnational in nature, they should aim to produce results that create or contribute to implementation of standards at European level, or that could be transferable to other Member States.</p><p>At least <strong>one public authority from each participating country must either be involved in the project (as applicant or co-applicant) or by providing substantial support</strong>. For projects related to gender-based violence, these public authorities can be national, regional or local Ministries/agencies/equality bodies responsible for gender equality and/or provision of services to victims of violence or perpetrators; police, judicial, health or education authorities etc., as relevant. For projects related to children, these public authorities can be Ministries and/or agencies responsible for children (e.g. child protection agencies and services, national guardianship institutions, Ministries for children, child protection, education, health, social affairs, justice, children's ombudspersons and/or national human rights institutes for children, responsible regional authorities, etc). The rationale for the choice must be documented and explained in Part B Project Description and Implementation. In practical terms, it means that if, for instance, a transnational project is submitted by a partnership involving four different eligible countries, at least four public authorities as described above (one per each eligible country) must either be involved in the project as applicant or partner(s) or express in writing their support for the application. In the latter case, this support will be expressed through Annex 5 - Letter from the public authority supporting the application.<strong> </strong>The requirement will be assessed under the award criterion <strong>b)</strong> <strong>quality.</strong></p><p><strong>Mainstreaming </strong></p><p>Projects funded under this call shall also seek to promote equality between women and men and the rights of the child. Gender and rights of the child mainstreaming means integrating a gender and rights of the child perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a project, as appropriate. Consequently, when relevant, the applicant shall take the necessary steps to ensure that gender equality and child-related issues are taken into account by paying attention to the situation and particular needs of women and men and of children. It is, for example, essential that projects do not silence, stereotype, stigmatise, lay the blame on or discriminate against women or men. Projects should contribute to empowering women and to ensuring that they achieve their full potential and enjoy the same rights as men.</p><p>All <strong>proposals relevant to children</strong> are expected to respect the <strong>child's right to participate</strong> and be aligned with Article 24 of the Charter, relevant EU law and the UN Convention on the rights of the child and describe how they will contribute to the implementation of the 10 principles for integrated child protection systems (see bibliography). The child's right to be heard, as set out in UNCRC Article 12 and General Comment No 12, must be an integral part of all project activities. Proposals must make children's involvement central and integral to the project, for example in designing and reviewing responses to reports and actual cases of child victims, in reviewing services, in assessing what needs to be changed at system level, in empowering children to be involved in decisions that affect them and in empowering children and young people to help themselves and other children, etc. Are there possibilities to involve children in project design prior to submission of proposals? Are the views of children on issues addressed in the call (possibly gathered elsewhere) reflected in the proposal? Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast (see bibliography).</p><p>Projects funded under this call shall also comply with the prohibition of discrimination based on any of the grounds listed in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the \"Charter\"), in accordance with and within the limits set by Article 51 of the Charter. Among others the Commission encourages applicants to promote equal employment opportunities for all its staff and team. The beneficiary is encouraged to foster an appropriate mix of people, whatever their ethnic origin, religion, age, gender and ability.</p><p>Finally, all projects under this call shall respect and shall be implemented in line with the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter.</p><p><strong>Child protection/safeguarding policy </strong></p><p>If a project will involve direct contact with children, the beneficiaries of funding (including partners) need to provide their child protection/safeguarding policy, if they work <em>directly</em> with children during the project. Each partner must provide their own child protection policy if they will be working directly with children. However, given the subject matter of these calls, for all projects concerning children, child safeguarding must be central to project design and implementation, for example for national coordinating frameworks, and must be addressed. The applicant must describe and submit the child protection/safeguarding policy it will adhere to (see Annex 4 of the Guide for applicants). A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in \"Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them\" issued by Keeping Children Safe (see bibliography). The quality of the applicant\u2019s child safeguarding/protection policy will be assessed under award criterion <strong>b) quality</strong>.</p><p><strong>Monitoring and evaluation</strong></p><p>Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator for further details please refer to \"Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making\", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): <a href=\"http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf\">http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf</a>), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. For priorities 1, 2 and 4, this should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group, e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, victims are more likely to report experiences of violence, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily/working life, etc. Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. For priorities 1, 2, 3 and 4, it should provide reliable results on \"what works\" and \"what does not work\" (for further details please refer to \"Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers\", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion) \u2013 see bibliography. Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by sex and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.</p><p><strong>Sustainability of projects and dissemination of results</strong></p><p>Applications should include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding.
