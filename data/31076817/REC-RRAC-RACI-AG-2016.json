Priorities and activities to be funded</strong></p><p><strong>1.1. Priorities</strong></p><p>Dialogue and exchange of best practice will assist Member States and national practitioners in fostering tolerance and mutual respect including through the correct and full implementation of the provisions of the EU Framework Decision on combatting certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, and in developing tools and practices to effectively prevent and combat bias-motivated crimes. Increased support in these actions also represents a follow up to the conclusions of the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights of 1-2 October 2015 and reflects relevant priorities identified in the European Agenda on Security and in the conclusions of the Justice Ministers discussion on the justice response to the migration crisis, held at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 8-9 October 2015.</p><p>The priorities of this call for proposals are:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li><strong>Grassroots projects on preventing and combating Antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred </strong>and intolerance (as a follow up of the 2015 Colloquium on Fundamental Rights event);</li>  <li>projects on preventing and combating <strong>homophobia and transphobia</strong>;</li>  <li>projects promoting the development of tools and practices <strong>to prevent (counter-narratives), monitor and combat online hate speech,</strong> including but not limited to means of criminal law (as a follow up of the Colloquium);</li>  <li>Projects to create <strong>better understanding between communities</strong>, including religious communities, and prevent and combat racism and xenophobia through interreligious and intercultural activities.</li> </ul><p><strong>1.2.
