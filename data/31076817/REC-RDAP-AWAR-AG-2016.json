Selected projects may be expected to integrate visuals and messages developed by the Commission in this context. Project leaders should be ready to present or showcase their activities and results at events during this year or through the Commission's social media and press activities. </strong></p><p><strong>1.1. Priorities</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>For the purpose of this call, gender-based violence is defined as violence directed against a person because of that person's gender (including gender identity/expression) or as violence that affects persons of a particular gender disproportionately.</p><p>As part of its work to combat gender-based violence, the Commission aims to prevent its incidence, encourage reporting and protect and support victims. The aim of this call is to contribute to education and awareness-raising to prevent and combat gender-based violence, in particular by changing attitudes and behaviours towards the phenomenon. Such education and awareness-raising should focus on providing girls and boys (under 18 years old) with information and skills related to gender equality, healthy relationships, gender stereotypes and roles, respect for others etc. Such initiatives should encourage critical thinking, so girls and boys challenge social norms that contribute to perpetuating gender-based violence. They should empower young people to claim their rights and to protect themselves in risky or violent situations, while ensuring that this does not only put the responsibility on the victim and contribute to victim-blaming. Awareness-raising and education aimed at encouraging bystander intervention is also welcome.</p><p>Awareness-raising and education activities can cover all forms of gender-based violence or focus on specific forms, such as female genital mutilation, forced marriage, or target particular groups who are vulnerable to such violence, such as LGBTI, ethnic or religious minorities, migrants etc.</p><p>Proposals shall complement the efforts of the EU in combating gender-based violence. Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission.</p><p><strong>1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic</strong></p><p>This call will cover one or more of the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Education and awareness-raising activities, such as campaigns, exhibitions, workshops;</li>  <li>Capacity-building and training for professionals and volunteers who come into contact with girls and boys and who are or will be involved in education to end gender-based violence, including teachers and teacher educators, peer mentors, school counsellors, sports coaches, youth leaders, organisers of extra-curricular activities and similar professionals and volunteers.</li> </ul><p>Activities can be carried out in formal and informal education or other contexts. Applicants should reflect on the framing of messages and the use of specific messengers (such as youth leaders, local celebrities, sports coaches etc.) when developing such awareness-raising and education activities. Pre-testing of messages among the target group is strongly encouraged. Multi-component campaigns, combining different methods of awareness-raising and education, are particularly encouraged.</p><p>Activities endorsing or reinforcing gender stereotypes or gender norms that are harmful, justify gender-based violence and contribute to victim-blaming will not be funded. Any messages, images or materials developed in the context of this call should be sensitive, challenge gender stereotypes (for instance, avoid representing women as passive victims and all men as perpetrators) and should in no way stigmatise victims or any specific group.</p><p>The following types of activities will <u>not </u>be funded by the Commission:</p><p>- activities supporting individual political parties;</p><p>- provision of financial support to third parties;</p><p>- legal actions before national or international courts regardless of their grounds or objectives;</p><p>- mapping of best practices or best practice guides/guidelines;</p><p>- the establishment of shelters or other infrastructure</p><p>- descriptive research reviews..</p><p>Although the continuation or follow-up of successful initiatives may be funded, the exact duplication of an initiative will not be funded.</p><p><strong>Child protection</strong></p><p>If a project will involve direct contact with children, the applicant must describe and submit the <strong>child protection/safeguarding policy </strong>it will adhere to<em>. </em>A child protection policy should include standards that cover four broad areas: (1) policy, (2) people, (3) procedures, and (4) accountability. More information on these areas can be found in \"Child safeguarding standards and how to implement them\" issued by Keeping Children Safe (<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/rights_child/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/files/rights_child/standards_child_protection_kcsc_en.pdf)</a>.</p><p>All proposals are expected to respect the child's right to participate, as codified in Article 24 of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT\">EU Charter of Fundamental Rights</a>, as well as reinforcing and respecting the child's right to be heard throughout all project activities, where possible, and with the necessary safeguards in place, project design should involve children who are service users. Accessible guidance on how to ensure child participation is also contained in the Lundy Model of Participation and the Lundy Voice Model Checklist for Participation, designed by Professor Laura Lundy of Queen's University, Belfast. Her models have, for example, been included in Ireland's National Strategy on Children and Young People's Participation in Decision-Making 2015-2020.</p><p><strong>Monitoring and evaluation</strong></p><p>Appropriate attention has to be given to developing a robust evidence base and involving reliable monitoring, evaluation and reporting procedures based on recognised methodological approaches, developed by a competent and experienced policy impact evaluator (for further details please refer to \"Applying Behavioural Sciences to EU Policy-making\", Joint Research Centre Scientific and Policy Report (2013): http://ftp.jrc.es/EURdoc/JRC83284.pdf), in consultation with the relevant project partners. This should include defining the expected impact of the activity in measurable terms and defining a robust methodology and indicators to measure the impact of the activity. This should go beyond simply surveying participants on their appreciation of activities and deliverables, and assess how activities and the use of deliverables have led to attitudinal and behavioural changes among the target group, e.g. there is lower tolerance of gender-based violence and the target group states they are more likely to intervene when witnessing it, or when witnessing a situation that could lead to gender-based violence, young people are aware of what constitutes respectful behaviour in relationships, the target group uses learned techniques in their daily life, etc.. Whenever possible, evaluations should encompass evidence on changes in both attitudes and behaviours, as a change in attitudes might not necessarily lead to a change in behaviour. When gathering evidence on attitudes, the evaluator should reflect on the possible effects of social desirability (i.e. the possibility that respondents do not state a particular opinion if they know that this opinion is not socially accepted).</p><p>Though applicants are free to choose the method for evaluating the impact of the activities, the method should be robust and appropriate, and involve rigorous data collection and monitoring. It should provide reliable results on \"what works\" and \"what does not work\" (for further details please refer to \"Social Experimentation - A methodological guide for policy makers\", Written by J-Pal Europe, at the request of Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion). Proposals must make provisions to document the number of persons/professionals/parents/teachers/volunteers/children reached, provide anonymised data disaggregated by gender and by age, and must describe in their grant application how this will be done and how the target group will be reached.</p><p>Applications should also include a clear communication, dissemination and sustainability plan, with measures to maintain and monitor results after the end of funding. Applicants should also describe the potential for scaling up the measure, should the activities produce the expected results.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>List of eligible countries<br />\r\n    <br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n    </strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">All EU Member States and Iceland</span><strong><br />\r\n    </strong></span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Eligibility&nbsp;and admissibility conditions</strong></span><br />\r\n    <strong><br />\r\n    </strong><span style=\"color: #000000\">2.1 Admissibility requirements are described under point 1 of part C of the </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/common/just-rec-guide-applicants_en.pdf\"><span style=\"color: #000000\">Guide for applicants</span></a><span style=\"color: #000000\"><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    2.2 Eligibility of the applicant and of the partners<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The applicants and partners must be public entities or private organisations or international organisations.
