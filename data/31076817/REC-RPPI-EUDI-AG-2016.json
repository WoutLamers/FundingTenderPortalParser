Priorities and activities to be funded</u></strong></p><p><strong>1.1. Priorities</strong></p><p>The aim of the pilot project on \"Europe of diversities\" is to enhance the motto of the European Union: \"United in diversity\" especially on local and regional level. With the pilot project EU citizens in regions with multicultural and multilingual background, or where minority groups are particularly excluded or subject to discrimination, would receive the possibility to understand better each other's culture, language and identity. Mutual understanding, acceptance and tolerance is a core element of fruitful coexistence of different ethnic, religious, national and linguistic groups, as well as of different generations and minority groups more generally. The pilot project would contribute to the work which has been already done in the field of non-discrimination, education and language learning, however the objective is to reach different groups of the society and to foster the multicultural dialogue between the EU citizens on local and regional level on one hand, and through the exchange of opportunities on EU-level on the other hand. One of the strengths and richness of the EU is in its diversity. Therefore it should be adequately promoted and made understood that it is an added value to the EU.</p><p><strong>1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic</strong></p><p>The pilot project aims to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>finance trainings, seminars, workshops, and conferences on how to maintain the uniqueness of Europe of diversities and how to promote unity in diversity;</p> </li>  <li> <p>promote the exchange of good practices in fighting discrimination and promoting diversity at local and regional level;</p> </li>  <li> <p>help to identify and target discriminatory practices at local and regional level and build understanding between majority and minority societies.</p> </li> </ul><p>Target group: local and regional stakeholders, in particular public authorities (cities, regions, municipalities), NGOs, youth organisations, schools, civil society and businesses.</p><p>While national projects are eligible, <strong>successful proposals should aim to produce results with EU added value.</strong></p><p>The indicative available budget under this call for proposals is EUR 1.000.000.</p><p>The requested grant should preferably <strong>not be higher than EUR 250.000 or lower than EUR 150.000</strong>.
