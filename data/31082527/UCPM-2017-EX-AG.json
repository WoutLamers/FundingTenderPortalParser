In broad terms, the Mechanism aims to provide support, upon request, in the event of major emergencies and to facilitate improved coordination of assistance intervention. It should facilitate the response to protect primarily people but also the environment and property, including cultural heritage, in the event of natural and man-made disasters, acts of terrorism and technological, radiological or environmental accidents, including accidental marine pollution, occurring inside or outside the European Union, taking into account the special needs of the isolated, outermost and other regions or islands of the European Union.</p><p>The term \"exercises\" refers to a range of activities that span from validate existing capabilities to exploring new ones, from focusing on a national response team's performance to focusing on the trans-governmental and cross-sectorial emergency response mechanisms. They are designed to enhance the readiness and capacities of national response and to test or validate crisis management procedures.</p><p>The purpose of this call is to enable and support exercise projects which provide opportunities in controlled environments to asses, learn from and improve the response capability of Participating States of the Mechanism and the European Commission.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The Civil Protection Work Programme 2017, in its Action 2.6, provides the framework for the implementation of the priorities set up in the legislation for the exercise programme:</p><p><em><u>The objective: </u></em></p><p><em>To improve civil protection preparedness and response to all kinds of disasters, including marine pollution</em><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup><em>, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) disasters, as well as combined disasters and disasters simultaneously affecting a number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the Mechanism) by providing a testing environment of established and/or new operational concepts and procedures of the Mechanism and a learning opportunity for all actors involved in civil protection assistance interventions under the Mechanism.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The expected results under this Call are:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p><em>Improving the response capacity of Member States, in particular with regard to teams and other assets provided in civil protection assistance interventions.</em></p> </li>  <li> <p><em>Improving and verifying the procedures and establishing a common approach for the coordination of civil protection assistance interventions and reducing the time taken to deploy in major disasters.</em></p> </li>  <li> <p><em>Enhancing cooperation between the civil protection and marine pollution services of the Member States, the Commission and other relevant actors.</em></p> </li>  <li> <p><em>Identifying and sharing lessons learned.</em></p> </li>  <li> <p><em>Testing the implementation of lessons learned </em></p> <p><strong>TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH CAN BE FINANCED UNDER THIS CALL </strong></p> <p>Plan, conduct and evaluate exercises with scenarios simulating the situation and conditions of all types of disasters for the activation of the Mechanism, including marine pollution and CBRN disasters, as well as combined disasters and disasters affecting simultaneously a number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the Mechanism). The plans for the exercises should also take into account the results of evaluations of previous exercises as well as lessons learned from civil protection actions. Needs of vulnerable groups including persons with disabilities should also be taken into consideration.</p> <p>The exercises can be full scale exercises, command post exercises with limited deployment, and table top exercises. A combination of two or three of these exercise concepts is considered as strength.</p> <p>The involvement of Member States is ensured through the ERCC, according to established procedures (e.g. use of CECIS, and activation of the Mechanism) and deployment of exercise participants as defined in Art. 32 of Commission Implementing Decision 2014/762/EU laying down rules for the implementation of Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism i.e. intervention teams (including modules), teams of assessment and/or coordination experts (EUCPT), national key contact point staff, other intervention support resources and officials of the EU Institutions, including humanitarian aid experts (if required by the scenario).</p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/thematic/disaster_risk_management_en.pdf\">More information about EU disaster risk management</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/funding-evaluations/financing-civil-protection/civil-protection-exercises_en\">More information about exercise projects co-financed under previous calls</a>.</p> </li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><em>Other marine incidents which are security related are also relevant.</em></p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding:</span></strong> Described in&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;4<span style=\"color: #ff0000\"> </span>of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/call/ucpm-call-document-exercise-2017_en.pdf\">Call document (UCPM Exercise)</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> Described in&nbsp;Chapter 7 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/call/ucpm-call-document-exercise-2017_en.pdf\">Call document (UCPM Exercise)</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.1. <span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</strong></span> Described in<span style=\"color: #ff0000\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000\">Chapter 7.4</span> of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/call/ucpm-call-document-exercise-2017_en.pdf\">Call document (UCPM Exercise)</a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.2. <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">For submission and evaluation process</span></strong>, see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/pse/ucpm-guide-applicants-exercise-17_en.pdf\">Guide for applicants</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/call/ucpm-call-document-exercise-2017_en.pdf\">Call document (UCPM Exercise)</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong> described in<span style=\"color: #ff0000\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000\">Chapter 5&nbsp;</span>of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/guide/call/ucpm-call-document-exercise-2017_en.pdf\">Call document (UCPM Exercise)</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>UCPM Internal Action Grant (UCPM-INT-AG):</u> <br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/ucpm/tpl/pt/ucpm-ex-ag_call-pt-17_en.pdf\">Standard proposal template</a>&nbsp;
