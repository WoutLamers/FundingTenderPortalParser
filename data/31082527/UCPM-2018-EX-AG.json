In broad terms, the Mechanism aims to provide support, upon request, in the event of major emergencies and to facilitate improved coordination of assistance intervention. It should facilitate the response to protect primarily people but also the environment and property, including cultural heritage, in the event of natural and man-made disasters, acts of terrorism and technological, radiological or environmental accidents, including accidental marine pollution, occurring inside or outside the European Union, taking into account the special needs of the isolated, outermost and other regions or islands of the European Union.</p><p>The term \"exercises\" refers to a range of activities that span from validate existing capabilities to exploring new ones, from focusing on a national response team's performance to focusing on the trans-governmental and cross-sectorial emergency response mechanisms. They are designed to enhance the readiness and capacities of national response and to test or validate crisis management procedures. </p><p>The purpose of this call is to enable and support exercise projects which provide opportunities in controlled environments to asses, learn from and improve the response capability of Participating States of the Mechanism and the European Commission. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The Civil Protection Work Programme 2018, in its Action 2.6, provides the framework for the implementation of the priorities set up in the legislation for the exercise programme:</p><p><em><u>The objective: </u></em></p><p>To improve civil protection preparedness and response to all kinds of</p><p>disasters, including marine pollution, forest fires and chemical, biological,</p><p>radiological, nuclear (CBRN) disasters, as well as combined disasters,</p><p>climate-change induced disasters, and disasters simultaneously affecting a</p><p>number of countries (inside or outside the Participating States of the</p><p>Mechanism) by providing a testing environment of established and/or new</p><p>operational concepts and procedures of the Mechanism and a learning</p><p>opportunity for all actors involved in civil protection assistance</p><p>interventions under the Mechanism.</p><p><strong>EXERCISE PRIORITIES</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li> <p><em>Deployment of assets and teams of the European Emergency Response Capacity (EERC);</em></p> </li><li> <p><em>Testing ERCC procedures;</em></p> </li><li> <p><em>Information exchange between affected country, Participating States and the ERCC;</em></p> </li><li> <p><em>Crisis communication.</em></p> </li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Improving the response capacity of Member States, in particular with</p><p>regard to teams and other assets provided in civil protection assistance</p><p>interventions.</p><p>Improving and verifying the procedures and establishing a common</p><p>approach for the coordination of civil protection assistance interventions</p><p>and reducing the time taken to deploy in major disasters.</p><p>Enhancing cooperation between the civil protection and marine pollution</p><p>services of Member States, the Commission and other relevant actors.</p><p>Identifying and sharing lessons learned.</p><p>Testing the implementation of lessons learned.</p><p><strong>TYPE OF ACTIVITIES WHICH CAN BE FINANCED UNDER THIS CALL</strong></p><p>Design, plan, conduct and evaluate exercises with scenarios simulating the</p><p>situation and conditions of all types of disasters for the activation of the</p><p>Mechanism, including marine pollution, forest fires, and CBRN disasters,</p><p>as well as combined disasters and disasters affecting simultaneously a</p><p>number of countries (inside or outside the participating states of the</p><p>Mechanism), taking into account climate change impacts where</p><p>appropriate. The design and planning for the exercises should also take</p><p>into account the results of evaluations of previous exercises as well as</p><p>lessons learned from civil protection actions. Towards the end of the</p><p>exercise project, recommendations and a plan to implement the</p><p>recommendations should be developed based on the findings that have</p><p>been outlined in the evaluation.</p><p>The exercises can be full-scale exercises, command post exercises with</p><p>limited deployment, and table top exercises. A combination of two or</p><p>three of these exercise concepts is considered as strength. The involvement</p><p>of Member States is ensured through the ERCC, according to established</p><p>procedures (e.g. use of CECIS, and activation of the Mechanism) and</p><p>deployment of exercise participants as defined in Article 32 of</p><p>Commission Implementing Decision 2014/762/EU laying down rules for</p><p>the implementation of Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European</p><p>Parliament and of the Council on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism14,</p><p>i.e. intervention teams (including modules), teams of assessment and/or</p><p>coordination experts (EUCPT), national key contact point staff, other</p><p>intervention support resources and officials of the EU Institutions,</p><p>including humanitarian aid experts (if required by the scenario).</p><p>The activation of the UCPM and the subject of the</p><p>Host Nation Support should be integrated in every Mechanism exercise.</p><p>For more information about EU disaster risk management:</p><p><a
