It covers at-sea and on-shore implications of deliberate and accidental spills of oil and other harmful substances.</p><p>Although shipping has become safer over the past decades, the current trend shows a considerable increase in ship size, increase in the overall maritime traffic and variety of possible pollutants transported as well as a reduced navigational space due to other maritime activities and demand for space, such as energy generation and marine protected areas. The reported number of small and \u2019\u2019unknown\u2019\u2019 spills has also risen significantly. These and other developments require further risk reduction and preparedness measures, including the use of advanced and innovative technologies as well as the evaluation and reinforcement of existing capacities. Furthermore, prevention, preparedness and response to marine and coastal pollution is often a responsibility of multiple authorities and specialised organisations within a country, making the overall pollution risk management rather challenging. Therefore, better ways of cross-sectoral cooperation of different authorities and actors involved should be explored and developped.</p><p>Finally, cooperation in combating marine pollution is deeply rooted in the cross-border and regional approach. While it is already well-advanced in some of the regional European seas, other regions have not yet established a strong framework for joint activities. Moreover, inter-regional cooperation on common priorities, sharing good practice, training and exercising could be strengthened.</p><p><strong>This topic aims to enhance prevention of and protection from the effects of maritime disasters.</strong></p><p>Aplicants are invited to focus on <strong><u>one of the following call priorities (specific objectives):</u></strong></p><p><strong>Priority 1: Developing response capacity for marine pollution incidents </strong></p><p>In order to contribute to achieving Priority 1, this Call for Proposals will co-finance activities that aim to step-up capacity of responders, including development of advanced methodologies supporting training and exercises as well as improving monitoring, detection and response to marine pollution. Such tools and methodologies should take into account or build on the recent initiatives undertaken at European or regional level.</p><p>In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the development of <strong>up to two (2) of the following outcomes</strong>:</p><p>1.1. Advanced training and/or exercising capacities are developed;</p><p>1.2. System(s) for detection of and response to various pollutants are developed or improved;</p><p>1.3. Innovative response capacities are tested through exercises.</p><p>Examples of project activities and <strong>outputs</strong> to be funded include, among others:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advanced training technologies or methodologies for a sound assessment and recovery of various pollutants at-sea and on-shore;</li><li>Exercise planning tool enabling a complete cycle of learning through exercises, lessons identified, training and lessons learnt for national and/or regional use;</li><li>Interactive pollutant simulation tool enabling comparison of different response strategies at-sea and on-shore taking into account relevant parameters;</li><li>Innovative systems and tools for detecting and recovering oil or other harmful substances;</li><li>Trainings and small-scale exercises aimed at testing innovative disaster preparedness approaches, methodologies and tools.</li> </ul><p>\u200b<strong>Priority 2: Enhancing regional and cross-sectorial coordination</strong></p><p>In order to contribute to achieving Priority 2, this Call will co-finance actions that aim to strengthen joint prevention and preparedness actions across maritime regions and sectors involved.</p><p>In particular, project activities and outputs should lead to the development of <strong>up to two (2) of the following outcomes</strong>:</p><p>2.1. Coordination within or between European regional sea conventions is enhanced;</p><p>2.2 Communication and operational coordination between at-sea and shoreline preparedness and response is enhanced;</p><p>2.3. Europe-wide maritime risk assessment capability is strengthened.</p><p>Examples of project activities and <strong>outputs</strong> to be funded include, among others:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development or upgrade of regional/inter-regional anti-pollution manual, guideline or procedures, closely linked with the European policies and crises management systems and tools;</li><li>Joint at-sea/on-shore response and/or exercise plan, taking into account European and international good practice and experience;</li><li>Joint at-sea/on-shore trainings and small scale exercises;</li><li>Integration of at-sea/on-shore operational and communication systems;</li><li>Europe-wide risk assessment tool, method or approach for European/regional/sub-regional/national risk assessments, e.g. able to assess efficiency of possible response actions to various spill scenarios as well as their environmental and socio economic impact;</li><li>Data collection/analysis, feasibility studies and other science-based tools in support of regional and cross-sectorial coordination.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><strong>1.
