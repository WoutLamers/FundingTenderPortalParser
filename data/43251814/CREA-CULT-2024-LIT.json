The activities may include the development, the creation, the production, the dissemination and the preservation of goods and services, which embody cultural, artistic or other creative expressions, as well as education or management, related to these activities. Those sectors include, inter alia, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, artistic crafts, audio-visual (including film, television, video games and multimedia), tangible and intangible cultural heritage, design (including fashion design), festivals, music, literature, performing arts, books and publishing, radio, and visual arts. </p><p>The <strong>general objectives</strong> <strong>of the Programme</strong> are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>to safeguard, develop and promote European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage.</li><li>to increase the competitiveness and the economic potential of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the audio-visual sector.</li> </ul><p>The objectives of the Programme consider the dual nature of the cultural and creative sectors, recognising, on the one hand, the intrinsic and artistic value of culture and, on the other, the economic value of those sectors, including their broader contribution to growth and competitiveness, creativity, and innovation. The objectives are pursued in a way that encourages inclusion, equality, diversity and participation, including, where appropriate, specific incentives that facilitate the active participation in the cultural and creative sectors of people with disabilities, people belonging to minorities and people belonging to socially marginalised groups, including both the creative process and audience development, and gender equality, in particular as a driver of economic growth, innovation and creativity. </p><p><u><em><strong>Policy framework</strong></em></u></p><p>The Creative Europe Programme contributes to <strong>European policy initiatives in the field of culture</strong>, notably the EU <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022G1207%2801%29&amp;qid=1671635488811\">Work Plan for Culture 2023-2026</a> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:267:FIN\">2018 New European Agenda for Culture</a>. The actions of the Programme will as well contribute to the implementation of the high-level initiatives such as the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus.</p><p>The Programme also takes into account recent Council Conclusions, including those adopted between 2021 and 2023, on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/49703/st08768-en21.pdf\">The recovery, resilience and sustainability of the cultural and creative sectors</a>\u201c, on \u201c<a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14534-2021-INIT/en/pdf\">Culture, high-quality architecture and built environment as key elements of the New European Bauhaus initiative</a>\u201d, on \u201c<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.C_.2022.160.01.0013.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AC%3A2022%3A160%3AFULL\">Building a European Strategy for the Cultural and Creative Industries Ecosystem</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7861-2022-INIT/xx/pdf\">Reinforcing intercultural exchanges through the mobility of artists and cultural and creative professionals, and through multilingualism in the digital era</a>\u201d and on \u201c<a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9260-2023-INIT/en/pdf\">At-risk and displaced artist</a><u>s</u>\u201d.</p><p>Creative Europe will take on board the priorities of the 2023 European Year of Skills as a continuous upskilling of the professionals of the sector is key to its competitiveness.</p><p>Building on the legacy of the European Year of Youth 2022, the Programme will continue to support cultural initiatives that engage, connect, and empower young people, either as audience and/or as emerging artists.</p><p>EU values being at the core of the EU programmes, beneficiaries and activities implemented within actions of the Creative Europe Programme have to respect the EU values reflected in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and the rights and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, particularly Article 21: respect of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, respect for human rights, non-discrimination based on sex, race, ethnic or social origins, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. </p><p>Activities shall also be implemented in line with the values enshrined in the declaration on European Digital rights and principles, which promotes a sustainable, human-centric vision for the digital transformation. </p><p><strong><em><u>2024 priorities: Culture strand</u></em></strong></p><p>The Programme will help to address the current political priorities, to contribute to resilience and recovery of the cultural and creative sectors, for them to become more crisis resistant. It will support Ukrainian culture and creative sectors (the participation of Ukrainian cultural and creative professionals will be encouraged in all Programme actions and will constitute an annual priority under the cooperation call). And finally, it will pursue priorities proper to the culture field and help to deal with the challenges it faces, as listed in the Annual Work Programme 2024. </p><p><strong>Making the cultural and creative sectors greener and more inclusive</strong></p><p>The Programme mainstreams through its actions the <strong>cross-cutting issues</strong> of (i) inclusion and diversity, notably gender balance, and (ii) greening of Creative Europe. In this respect:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li><strong>inclusion and diversity, notably gender balance</strong>: projects shall facilitate access to European cultural and creative content for all groups and audiences, especially for professionals and participants with disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities related to disability or health problems, including mental health, economic, social or geographical obstacles to promote societal resilience, enhance social inclusion and allow for intercultural dialogue. Particular attention will be paid to fostering gender equality (in line with the EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-equality-strategy_en\">Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025</a>, taking inspiration in the <a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/toolkits/gender-impact-assessment/guide-gender-impact-assessment\">Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit</a>), in particular as a driver of creativity, economic growth and innovation. All activities funded under the programme must incorporate a gender equality perspective and contribute to the equal empowerment of women and men, ensuring that they achieve their full potential and benefit from the same rights.</li><li><strong>greening of Creative Europe</strong>: projects shall contribute to the European Green Deal, in particular, by making efforts to adopt more environmentally sustainable (green) practices, strengthen synergies, build up capacity and knowledge and disseminate green ideas and, by this, contribute to the achievement of the overall target of 30% of the Union budget expenditure supporting climate objectives. Culture on one hand can play an important role in the green transition through awareness-raising, learning, communication, and on another has the potential to develop innovative ways of tackling environmental challenges and to minimize the impact on environment. The <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/e20ac9a0-f52b-11ed-a05c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Study on Greening the Creative Europe Programme</a> has established that an expertise for the greening of the creative and cultural sectors exists.
