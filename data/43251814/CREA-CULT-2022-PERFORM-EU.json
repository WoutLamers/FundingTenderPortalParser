The activities may include the development, the creation, the production, the dissemination and the preservation of goods and services, which embody cultural, artistic or other creative expressions, as well as education or management, related to these activities. The sectors include, inter alia, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, artistic crafts, audiovisual (including film, television, video games and multimedia), tangible and intangible cultural heritage, design (including fashion design), festivals, music, literature, performing arts, books and publishing, radio, and visual arts. </p><p>The general objectives of the Programme are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>to safeguard, develop and promote European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage;</li><li>to increase the competitiveness and the economic potential of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the audiovisual sector.</li> </ul><p><u><em>Policy framework</em></u></p><p>In 2022, the CULTURE strand of Creative Europe continues to be anchored to policy development and EU policy cooperation in the field of culture, notably in line with the objectives of the <strong><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0267\">2018 New European Agenda for Culture</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018XG1221(01)\">Council Work Plan for Culture 2019-2022</a></strong>. Policy cooperation and actions of the programme will also cover emerging priorities \u2013 such as the contribution to the EU Strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life - and high-level initiatives such as the <strong><a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">New European Bauhaus</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=\"https://europa.eu/youth/year-of-youth_en\">European Year of Youth 2022</a></strong>.</p><p>In light of the dramatic situation in Ukraine, Creative Europe stands for promoting the key value of culture and creativity in building inclusive and cohesive societies founded on the European values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and the respect for human rights. Therefore, Creative Europe will provide support to Ukrainian artists and cultural operators as well as to Ukrainian cultural and creative organisations in these extremely challenging times. In line with the exchanges at Council level and the <a href=\"https://presidence-francaise.consilium.europa.eu/en/news/declaration-of-the-european-ministers-responsible-for-culture-and-media-on-the-situation-in-ukraine/\">declaration</a> adopted by the European ministers responsible for culture, audiovisual and media in March 2022, the EU is dedicated to using any available European programme and framework relevant in the fields of culture, audiovisual and media, and in particular Creative Europe, for artists, journalists, and cultural and media professionals that are affected by the military aggression against Ukraine and its consequences.</p><p>The Programme is also in line with the 2016 Joint Commission/High Representative Communication <a href=\"JOIN/2016/029\">\"Towards an EU strategy for international cultural relations</a>\" and the 2014 Commission Communication <a href=\"COM/2014/0477%20final\">\"Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\"</a>, which all plead for a stronger role for culture in the further social, economic and international development of our Union.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/economy-works-people/jobs-growth-and-investment/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-action-plan_en\">European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan</a>, the Programme supports promotion of <strong>fair working conditions, including fair remuneration for all cultural and creative professionals</strong>. The Study on the working conditions of artists, cultural and creative professionals, including initiatives for the fair remuneration of artists and cultural professionals, recently published by the <a href=\"https://culture.ec.europa.eu/news/study-on-artists-working-conditions-published\">European Commission and stakeholders, deserves special attention</a>.</p><p><em><u>Culture strand 2022 priorities</u></em></p><p>The 2022 priorities of the CULTURE strand are defined in the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/sites/default/files/2022-01/creative-europe-annual-work-programme-2022.pdf\"><strong>Creative Europe Annual work-programme 2022</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p><em><u>Cross-cutting issues</u></em></p><p>As cross-cutting issues, the Programme will support effective mechanisms to ensure the cultural sectors offer diversity, inclusion and equality for all and contribute to the fight against climate change.</p><p><strong>Inclusion, diversity, and gender equality</strong>. Projects should facilitate access to European cultural and creative content for all groups and audiences, especially for professionals and participants with disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities related to disability or health problems, economic, social or geographical obstacles or cultural differences. Particular attention will be paid to fostering gender equality, in particular as a driver of creativity, economic growth and innovation. Projects must seek to promote gender equality and non-discrimination mainstreaming in accordance with the <a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/toolkits/gender-impact-assessment/guide-gender-impact-assessment\">Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit</a>. All activities funded under the programme must incorporate a gender equality perspective and contribute to the equal empowerment of women and men, ensuring that they achieve their full potential and benefit from the same rights.</p><p><strong>Environment and the fight against climate change</strong>. The cultural and creative sectors should contribute to the European Green Deal, in particular, by encouraging its operators to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and, by this, to contribute to the achievement of the overall target of 30% of the Union budget expenditures supporting climate objectives. Culture can play an important role in the green transition through awareness-raising, learning, communication and in the sharing of knowledge and good practices, and has the potential to develop innovative ways of tackling environmental challenges.</p><p><strong>PERFORM EUROPE BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>Cross-border mobility of people and distribution of art works, as well as the free flow of ideas, are central to the European project. They contribute to the two overarching objectives of the Creative Europe programme as they are major drivers of cultural diversity and it reinforces the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors by reaching out to new audiences and new markets. </p><p>As announced in the <strong><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0267\">New European Agenda for Culture</a></strong> \u201c<em>To increase [cultural] participation, greater circulation of European artworks and of professionals in the European cultural and creative sectors is required</em>.\u201d</p><p>Following and complementing the successful implementation of the pilot for a new mobility scheme for artists and culture professionals (<a href=\"https://culture.ec.europa.eu/news/culture-moves-europe-commission/\">i-portunus</a>), another pilot called <em><a href=\"https://performeurope.eu/\">Perform Europe was launched in 2020 to test the cross-border distribution of European performing art works (physical and digital)</a></em>. </p><p>In line with the sectorial approach adopted by the Creative Europe programme and considering that the performing arts sector has been among the worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic the focus of this call is on performing arts works. Under this call, <strong>performing arts </strong><strong>will include the following sub-sectors: theatre, dance, performance, circus, outdoor arts and puppetry. </strong></p><p>It is complementary to the <a href=\"https://culture.ec.europa.eu/cultural-and-creative-sectors/music/music-moves-europe\">Music Moves Europe</a> initiative that is entirely dedicated to music, therefore <strong>live music performances are not to be considered within this call.</strong></p><p>While the rich diversity of the performing arts sector in Europe is a major asset for European societies, a number of critical obstacles prevent performing arts works from circulating beyond national borders: market and sector fragmentation, linguistic barriers for theatre, travel costs, logistics issues, insurance, copyright, etc. Beyond the negative impact on the performing arts companies and hosting venues, these obstacles to cross-border distribution are hampering the potential of the sector to contribute to the EU's social, economic and integration ambitions, and to the building of a strong internal market and of a European society rooted in shared values and common cultural heritage. </p><p>Investing in a dedicated and flexible distribution scheme at EU level to help performing arts works cross borders (physically and digitally) shall usefully supplement other existing distribution and support schemes. It shall thereby sustain the resilience and the recovery of the sector in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis as well as reinforce its potential to contribute to the European project and values.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Nov 9, 2022 2:18:45 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 9, 2022 2:18:45 PM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; font-style: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-weight: inherit;\">PROPOSAL NUMBERS</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.618; font-family: eui-default, Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); margin: 0px !important;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Call CREA-CULT-2022-PERFORM-EU - Perform EU has closed on the 08/11/2022 17h00.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.618; font-family: eui-default, Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); margin: 0px !important;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">5 proposals have been submitted.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 1.618; font-family: eui-default, Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); margin: 0px !important;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in December 2022.</span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 7, 2022 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 7, 2022 12:00:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CREA-CULT-2022-PERFORM-EU(CREA-PJG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
