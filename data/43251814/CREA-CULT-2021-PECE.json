The sectors include, inter alia, architecture, archives, libraries and museums, artistic crafts, audiovisual (including film, television, video games and multimedia), tangible and intangible cultural heritage, design (including fashion design), festivals, music, literature, performing art (including theatre and dance), books and publishing, radio, and visual arts. </p><p><span><span>The general objectives of the Programme are: </span></span> </p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span><span>to safeguard, develop and promote European cultural and linguistic diversity and heritage; </span></span> </li><li><span><span>to increase the competitiveness and the economic potential of the cultural and creative sectors, in particular the audiovisual sector.</span></span> </li> </ul><p><span><span>These goals are pursued through the following <strong>specific objectives</strong>:</span></span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span><span>enhancing artistic and cultural cooperation at the European level, in order to support the creation of European works and strengthen the economic, social and external dimension of and innovation and mobility in Europe\u2019s cultural and creative sectors (<strong>CULTURE strand</strong>);</span></span> </li><li><span><span>promoting the competitiveness, scalability, cooperation, innovation, and sustainability, including through mobility in the European audiovisual sector (<strong>MEDIA strand</strong>); and </span></span> </li><li><span><span>promoting policy cooperation and innovative actions supporting all strands of the programme, promoting a diverse, independent and pluralistic media environment, and media literacy, thereby fostering freedom of artistic expression, intercultural dialogue and social inclusion (<strong>CROSS SECTORAL strand</strong>). </span></span> </li> </ul><p><em><u><span style=\"color:#C00000;\">Policy framework</span></u></em> </p><p><span><span>Creative Europe is fully aligned with the <strong>political priorities of the Commission</strong></span></span><span><span> and the 2018 Commission Communication on a </span></span><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2018%3A267%3AFIN\"><span><span>New European Agenda for Culture</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span><span><span> Supporting the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 and the European Green Deal are considered cross-cutting issues.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The Programme is also aligned with the Council\u2019s multiannual </span></span><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018XG1221(01)\"><span><span>Work Plan for Culture (2019-2022)</span></span></a><span><span>, the 2016 Joint Communication </span></span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/policies/international-cultural-relations\"><span><span>Towards an EU strategy for international cultural relations</span></span></a><span><span> and the 2014 Commission Communication </span></span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/assets/eac/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf\"><span><span>Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe</span></span></a><span><span>, which all plead for a stronger role for culture in the further social, economic and international development of our Union.</span></span> </p><p><span><span>The Programme will also focus on supporting the policy objectives of the <strong>Digital Single Market </strong>and the<strong>#Digital4Culture </strong>strategy.</span></span> </p><p><span><span>The Programme, while preserving its essential nature, will contribute to the </span></span><a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/about/about-initiative_en\"><span><span>New European Bauhaus</span></span><span><span><span> initiative</span></span></span><span><span>, </span></span></a><span><span>connecting the European Green Deal to our living spaces and will contribute as well to the </span></span><a href=\"https://europa.eu/year-of-rail/index_en\"><span><span>European Year of Rail 2021</span></span></a><span><span>,</span></span><span><span> highlighting the benefits of rail as a sustainable, smart and safe means of transport and encouraging the use of rail.</span></span></p><p>In accordance with the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/economy-works-people/jobs-growth-and-investment/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-action-plan_en\">European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan</a>, the Programme supports promotion of fair working conditions, including fair remuneration for all cultural and creative professionals. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/news/study-artists-working-conditions-published\">Study on the working conditions of artists, cultural and creative professionals</a>, including initiatives for the fair remuneration of artists and cultural professionals, recently published by the European Commission and stakeholders, deserves special attention.</p><p><span><span>The COVID-19 crisis was an accelerator of change in the cultural and creative sectors, amplifying many of the challenges they have been facing. The cultural and creative sectors have been amongst the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis</span>, which has accelerated the existing trends driven by globalisation and the digital transition. The combination of restrictive hygiene rules and the economic recession have created immediate drops in revenue and cash flow as well as accelerated structural change. There is a need to pool resources and support initiatives that promote the <strong>resilience and recovery</strong> of cultural operators, artists and cultural professionals, who have been profoundly affected by lockdowns and physical distancing measures.</span> </p><p><span><span>The <strong>digital transition</strong> accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing about a change of paradigm, significantly impacting how cultural goods are created, managed, disseminated, accessed and monetised.</span></span> </p><p><span><span>The richness, which stems from Europe's <strong>cultural and linguistic diversity</strong>, does not easily benefit European citizens, because the cultural and creative sectors are too often fragmented along national and linguistic lines and lack critical mass. The <strong>transnational circulation </strong>and co-production of works remain limited and it is therefore important to develop effective solutions to reach audiences across borders.</span></span></p><p><span><span>These challenges, of a transnational nature, require a targeted European approach to optimise the potential of the sectors to contribute to jobs, growth and social inclusion, including for the most disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups. The Programme will support actions and activities with a <strong>European added value</strong>, which complement regional, national, international and other Union programmes and policies.</span></span></p><p><em><u><span style=\"color:#C00000;\">Culture strand 2021 priorities </span></u></em></p><p><span><span>In 2021, the Culture strand of the new Creative Europe programme intends to promote: </span></span> </p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span><span>Reinforcement of the <strong>resilience to</strong> allow the <strong>recovery of cultural operators </strong>in light of the COVID-19 crisis.</span></span></li><li><strong><span><span>Innovation and joint creations: </span></span></strong><span><span>the Programme will support operators to develop innovative European projects to allow the evolution of the cultural and creative sectors and to increase their competitiveness. Innovations can be of a technological and artistic nature and can include the development and experimentation of new practices or new models or the transfer and dissemination of good practices from one European region or sector to others. Areas of innovation can include fighting climate change, digitisation or a societal dimension such as audience development, gender equality, the inclusion of people with disabilities, belonging to minorities, to socially marginalised groups. </span></span></li><li><strong><span><span>Co-production, cooperation, learning and connection </span></span></strong><span><span>of organisations of all sizes and that will build capacity, help the circulation of artists and works, give rise to co-productions and artistic creations and contribute to disseminating professional and artistic good practices across Europe.</span></span></li><li><strong><span><span>Capacity building of artists:</span></span></strong><span><span> the Programme will help European artists and cultural and creative professionals move up to the European level by supporting (emerging) talents and skills development. Platforms will be supported to increase the visibility and the circulation of European emerging artists and works in Europe and beyond. It will also support actions that promote the circulation of European literary works allowing the book sector (booksellers, libraries, etc.) to foster cooperation between publishers and their partners.</span></span></li><li><span><span>The programme will invest in activities that encourage the <strong>scaling up of Europe\u2019s cultural and creative sectors </strong>at European and global levels, for instance by supporting their <strong>international presence</strong>, marketing and branding. It will help collect and disseminate data, information, practices, ideas and solutions; provide training and advice to professionals; represent the sectors at national and European level and advocate on their behalf on key sectoral issues.</span></span> </li> </ul><p><em><u><span style=\"color:#C00000;\">Cross-cutting issues</span></u></em></p><p><span><span>In addition, as cross-cutting issues, the Programme will support effective mechanisms to ensure the cultural sectors offer diversity, inclusion and equality for all and contribute to the fight against climate change.</span></span> </p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong><span><span>Inclusion, diversity, and gender equality. </span></span></strong> <span><span>Projects should facilitate access to European cultural and creative content for all groups and audiences, especially</span></span><span><span> for professionals and participants with disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities related to disability or health problems, economic, social or geographical obstacles or cultural differences. </span></span><span><span>Particular attention will be given to fostering gender equality, in particular as a driver of creativity, economic growth and innovation. Projects must seek to promote gender equality and non-discrimination mainstreaming in accordance with the </span></span><a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/toolkits/gender-impact-assessment/guide-gender-impact-assessment\"><span><span>Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit</span></span></a><span><span>. All activities funded under the programme shall incorporate a gender equality perspective and contribute to the equal empowerment of women and men, ensuring that they achieve their full potential and benefit from the same rights.</span></span></li><li><strong><span><span>Environment and the fight against climate change. </span></span></strong><span><span>The cultural and creative sectors should contribute to the European Green Deal, in particular, by encouraging its operators to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and, by this, to contribute to the achievement of the overall target of 30% of the Union budget expenditures supporting climate objectives. Culture can play an important role in the green transition through awareness-raising, learning, communication and in the sharing of knowledge and good practices, and has the potential to develop innovative ways of tackling environmental challenges.</span></span></li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 15, 2021 3:01:10 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 15, 2021 3:01:10 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CREA-CULT-2021-PECE(CREA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
