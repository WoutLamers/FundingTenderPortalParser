The cultural and creative sectors have been amongst the hardest hit by the COVID-19 crisis, which has accelerated the existing trends driven by globalisation and the digital transition. The combination of restrictive hygiene rules and the economic recession have created immediate drops in revenue and cash flow as well as accelerated structural change. There is a need to pool resources and support initiatives that promote the <strong>resilience and recovery</strong> of cultural operators, artists and cultural professionals, who have been profoundly affected by lockdowns and physical distancing measures.</p><p>The <strong>digital transition</strong> accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing about a change of paradigm, significantly impacting how cultural goods are created, managed, disseminated, accessed and monetised.</p><p>The richness, which stems from Europe's <strong>cultural and linguistic diversity</strong>, does not easily benefit European citizens, because the cultural and creative sectors are too often fragmented along national and linguistic lines and lack critical mass. The <strong>transnational circulation </strong>and co-production of works remain limited and it is therefore important to develop effective solutions to reach audiences across borders.</p><p>These challenges, of a transnational nature, require a targeted European approach to optimise the potential of the sectors to contribute to jobs, growth and social inclusion, including for the most disadvantaged and hard-to-reach groups. The Programme will support actions and activities with a <strong>European added value</strong>, which complement regional, national, international and other Union programmes and policies.</p><p><em><u><span style=\"color:#C00000;\">Culture strand 2021 priorities </span></u></em></p><p>In 2021, the Culture strand of the new Creative Europe programme intends to promote:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reinforcement of the <strong>resilience to</strong> allow the <strong>recovery of cultural operators </strong>in light of the COVID-19 crisis.</li><li><strong>Innovation and joint creations: </strong>the Programme will support operators to develop innovative European projects to allow the evolution of the cultural and creative sectors and to increase their competitiveness. Innovations can be of a technological and artistic nature and can include the development and experimentation of new practices or new models or the transfer and dissemination of good practices from one European region or sector to others. Areas of innovation can include fighting climate change, digitisation or a societal dimension such as audience development, gender equality, the inclusion of people with disabilities, belonging to minorities, to socially marginalised groups.</li><li><strong>Co-production, cooperation, learning and connection </strong>of organisations of all sizes and that will build capacity, help the circulation of artists and works, give rise to co-productions and artistic creations and contribute to disseminating professional and artistic good practices across Europe.</li><li><strong>Capacity building of artists:</strong> the Programme will help European artists and cultural and creative professionals move up to the European level by supporting (emerging) talents and skills development. Platforms will be supported to increase the visibility and the circulation of European emerging artists and works in Europe and beyond. It will also support actions that promote the circulation of European literary works allowing the book sector (booksellers, libraries, etc.) to foster cooperation between publishers and their partners.</li><li>The programme will invest in activities that encourage the <strong>scaling up of Europe\u2019s cultural and creative sectors </strong>at European and global levels, for instance by supporting their <strong>international presence</strong>, marketing and branding. It will help collect and disseminate data, information, practices, ideas and solutions; provide training and advice to professionals; represent the sectors at national and European level and advocate on their behalf on key sectoral issues.</li> </ul><p><em><u><span style=\"color:#C00000;\">Cross-cutting issues</span></u></em></p><p>In addition, as cross-cutting issues, the Programme will support effective mechanisms to ensure the cultural sectors offer diversity, inclusion and equality for all and contribute to the fight against climate change.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Inclusion, diversity, and gender equality. </strong> Projects should facilitate access to European cultural and creative content for all groups and audiences, especially for professionals and participants with disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities related to disability or health problems, economic, social or geographical obstacles or cultural differences. Particular attention will be given to fostering gender equality, in particular as a driver of creativity, economic growth and innovation. Projects must seek to promote gender equality and non-discrimination mainstreaming in accordance with the <a href=\"https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/toolkits/gender-impact-assessment/guide-gender-impact-assessment\"><span style=\"color:#0088CC;\">Gender Mainstreaming Toolkit</span></a>. All activities funded under the programme shall incorporate a gender equality perspective and contribute to the equal empowerment of women and men, ensuring that they achieve their full potential and benefit from the same rights.</li><li><strong>Environment and the fight against climate change. </strong>The cultural and creative sectors should contribute to the European Green Deal, in particular, by encouraging its operators to adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and, by this, to contribute to the achievement of the overall target of 30% of the Union budget expenditures supporting climate objectives. Culture can play an important role in the green transition through awareness-raising, learning, communication and in the sharing of knowledge and good practices, and has the potential to develop innovative ways of tackling environmental challenges.</li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 10, 2021 10:03:31 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 10, 2021 10:03:31 AM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\">The ma</span><span style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\">ximum </span><span style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;\">page limit for Part B has been increased&nbsp; from 70 to 125 pages.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jun 22, 2021 10:12:19 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 22, 2021 10:12:19 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CREA-CULT-2021-PLAT(CREA-LS)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jun 21, 2021 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 21, 2021 12:00:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CREA-CULT-2021-PLAT(CREA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
