Uninterrupted supply from trusted sources of key materials, including raw materials, components and technologies for critical armament systems is fundamental for the reliable use of military capabilities when and where needed. Trusted supply without limitations from non EU countries regarding the use or export is also essential for the competitiveness of the EU defence industry, allowing competing in global markets with technological solutions that do not have to respect third parties conditions.</p><p>In the short and medium term, technologies subject to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations and Export Administration Regulations (ITAR and EAR) are as a consequence a challenge for Member States and defence industry as they limit freedom of action and export. Furthermore also currently freely available components may become ITAR-related once they are used in US weapon systems. Technologies and materials from other non EU sources may also be procured with restriction of use and components are often not trustable for sensitive functions. Moreover supply may even be denied in some particular cases with potentially highly detrimental impact on systems and operations. To support Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy availability of selected ITAR restricted and other foreign-sourced components and materials in Europe would be as beneficial for Member States as for Europe\u2019s defence industry.</p><p>Avoiding long term critical defence technology dependencies is equally important for the future strategic autonomy of the EU. Identifying critical technology building blocks for future defence systems and disruptive capabilities and preparing the necessary steps to have them available on time, is indispensable in order to avoid staying behind from the global competitors, prevent future technology dependencies and ensure the independent development of cutting edge capabilities.</p><p>To gain an overview about the technology dependence challenge, a stocktaking of ITAR and other non EU sourced components used in Europe\u2019s armament systems would be the first step to tackle this issue. A methodology consulting Member States and defence industry would need to assess the sourcing risk and criticality in order to identify and prioritize components and materials desirable to be available in Europe in the future. For selected technologies, roadmaps and business models can be produced to provide proposals for research topics for a follow on defence research programme.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This action should aim to provide an effective way for tackling the issue of the critical defence technological dependencies for the EU regarding current and future systems and capabilities. The action needs to address at least the following activities:</p><p>(a) Mapping of the ITAR and other non EU sourced components and materials in the systems developed by the EU industry and used and to be used by the EU armed forces. The mapping should cover the dependencies in the full spectrum of the value chain, possibly down to the raw material sourcing;</p><p>(b) Identify critical technology building blocks and possibly components for future systems and disruptive capabilities for which European technology non-dependence will be crucial. The activity should be based on the results of the European Defence Technology Runway Part I on future trends and aim to identify the major technical challenges in these critical areas for which non-dependence will be crucial;</p><p>(c) Develop a methodology to assess the supply risk of technologies and components of point a) and b) and their criticality for armed forces and the defence industry. Such methodology should be established in consultation with ministries of defence and the defence industry;</p><p>(d) Prepare technology roadmaps, ideally including cost substantiated predictions, and suggest business models for selected technologies, taking into account supply risk and criticality. An assessment of the scientific, technological and manufacturing readiness of the European ecosystem should be included. This activity should also propose actions in line with the technology roadmaps and suggested business models.</p><p>The activities should benefit and when appropriate complement or incorporate existing works, and in particular:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the European Defence Technology Runway Part I, for identifying technologies and sharing methodology as appropriate;</li><li>the study \u201cStudy on the dual-use potential of dual-use potential of Key Enabling Technologies (KETs)\u201d<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>;</li><li>the study \u201cRaw materials in the European defence industry\u201d<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> and relevant activities of the Joint Research Centre;</li><li>relevant work of the European Defence Agency, the \u201cLeadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies - Space\u201d research programme under Horizon 2020 and the European Space Agency (ESA), and in particular the Critical Space Technologies non-dependence actions for identified in the frame of the Commission-ESA-EDA Joint Task Force<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should include elements to ensure continued monitoring and updating beyond the action's lifetime.</p><p>The European Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the Union in the range of EUR 1 500 000 to 1 900 000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>This topic is complementary with topic <em>\"PADR-STF-01-2017: The European Defence Research Runway \u2013 part I\"</em>.
