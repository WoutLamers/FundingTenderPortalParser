One of the pre-conditions to integrate it is to increase availability and quality of connectivity to broadband Internet services for schools and classrooms, especially in rural and low population density areas, through the adoption of dedicated measures.</p><p>In its Communication<sup>2</sup> on \u201cOpening up Education: Innovative teaching and learning for all through new Technologies and Open Educational Resources\u201d, the Commission underlined that enhancing local ICT infrastructure (broadband, content, tools) is still needed in some parts of Europe and that Member States are investing in upgrading their national educational infrastructure (ICT, digital educational resources, broadband) but fragmentation and incoherence among EU Member States persists<sup>3</sup>. Innovating in the education sector remains a key priority for the Commission in its Communication on \u201cConnectivity for a Competitive Digital Single Market \u2013 Towards a European Gigabit Society\u201d<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>The European Parliament Resolution<sup>5</sup> on internet connectivity for growth, competitiveness and cohesion: European Gigabit society and 5G, welcomed the ambitious plan to provide ultra-fast internet in primary and secondary schools, universities and libraries by 2025, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. It also stressed that faster and better connectivity provides huge opportunities to enhance teaching methods, to foster research and to develop high quality educational services online as well as to create better opportunities for distance learning. The European Parliament also emphasised that, in order for the Gigabit target to have its full impact on our economy and not to miss opportunities, it is important to close the digital divide and prevent the opening of new divides. To this end, funding opportunities should be explored by Member States and the Commission in support of the achievement for the main socio-economic drivers (schools, universities, public administrations).</p><p>In 2015, the Commission published a call for tenders for a feasibility study on the provision of satellite broadband for schools located in rural areas and not covered by any fixed wired or wireless broadband. In 2016, many schools in the EU still lacked broadband access (especially in primary schools, 25% of which have no broadband access or even no Internet access at all). The main reasons behind this situation are: poor awareness among schools and local authorities of the technical options available to access broadband Internet; a limited number of dedicated, large national institutional support programmes; lack of knowledge of possible funding options, including voucher schemes, and how to implement them. The study report \u201cSatellite broadband for schools: Feasibility study\u201d (SMART 2015/0061)<sup>6</sup>, was published in September 2017. It confirmed that the use of satellite-based access and distribution is an efficient solution to make broadband Internet and educational multimedia contents immediately available to schools that are now unconnected or poorly connected, and may remain in this situation for a few years from now.</p><p>The purpose of the pilot project is to contribute to attaining the general policy objective taking stock of the findings of the study referred to above.</p><p>The Commission has decided to implement this pilot project through the award of a grant following the publication of a call for proposals.</p><p><br><sup>1</sup> C(2019) 1646 of 5.3.2019</p><p><sup>2</sup> COM(2013) 654 of 25.9.2013</p><p><sup>3</sup> On average, 93% of EU students access the internet at home, but only 72% have access to it at a place of education, and sometimes not in the classroom.
