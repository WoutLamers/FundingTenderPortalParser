It is a concrete concept to develop innovation and valorise available research results in a specific value chain. The development of the business and investment cases is facilitated by the regional innovation ecosystems with companies in the lead. I3 business investment cases have a <strong>minimum TRL 6</strong> and have the ambition to facilitate demonstration and to accelerate market uptake and commercialisation.</p><p>The goal is to mobilise tangible and intangible investments in companies, in particular small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To enable less developed regions to participate in EU value chains, contributing to cohesion policy objectives.</li><li>To link and align the bottom-up process centred on \u201centrepreneurial discovery\u201d that involves interactions among quadruple helix actors to identify new regional technological domains and market opportunities with the EU priorities; and to bridge the gap between the supply and demand sides and help innovation ecosystems overcome market failures.</li><li>To provide support for companies (in particular SMEs) in building portfolios of interregional innovation investments in shared or complementary S3 priority areas; and to support the demonstration, market uptake and scaling up of mature innovations to be brought on the market.</li> </ul><p>Under this call, applicants have the possibility to include Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) in the form of \u201cCascade funding\u201d for grants in their proposal. FSTP allows to select SMEs during the implementation phase in order to contribute to the investment project by carrying out necessary and missing tasks e.g., to complete a specific value chain and/or to offer a specific groundwork for testing and optimising products and production processes, or for the exploration of new processing technologies. The costs for financial support to third parties cannot exceed <strong>30%</strong> of the total eligible costs.</p><p>At least <strong>70%</strong> of the total eligible costs must be allocated to investments in companies, with a focus on SMEs.</p><p>In line with the New European Innovation Agenda, this call for proposals seeks to bring together regions at different levels of development and less and more innovative regions, which share an ambition to become Regional Innovation Valleys and reinforce coordination of research and innovation activities towards EU priorities and the most burning challenges facing the EU (namely reducing the reliance on fossil fuels, increasing global food security, mastering the digital transformation including cybersecurity, improving health care and achieving circularity). This call is about accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech innovation.</p><p>Applicants are therefore encouraged to actively engage with the wider community including innovation ecosystems and (future) Regional Innovation Valleys, in particular in the framework of the Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/policy/communities-and-networks/s3-community-of-practice_en\">Smart Specialisation Community of Practice</a> and relevant Thematic Smart Specialisation Partnerships.</p><p>This call for proposals is launched in coordination with the 2023-2024 Horizon Europe European Innovation Ecosystems (EIE) Work Programme on Implementing co-funded action plans for connected Regional Innovation Valleys.</p><p>Under this call for proposals regions will be recognised as Regional Innovation Valleys under the following conditions:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the competent regional or national institution or body, responsible for the management of the smart specialisation strategy (S3) confirms in the endorsement letter (see section 5) that its region wants to be recognised as a Regional Innovation Valley; and</li><li>the grant agreement of the I3 project has been fully signed.</li> </ul><p><strong><em><u>Thematic priorities - I3-2023-INV1</u></em></strong></p><p>Applications under this call for proposals must address one of the following thematic priorities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Digital transition or</li><li>Green transition or</li><li>Smart manufacturing</li> </ul><p>linked to the burning challenges identified in the New European Innovation Agenda.</p><p>Each project application under this call must address one thematic priority and at least one burning challenge. Applicants wishing to apply for more than one thematic priority, must submit a separate proposal.</p><p><strong>Digital transition</strong></p><p><em><u>Objectives</u></em></p><p>Digital technologies present an enormous growth potential for Europe. In line with the Europe fit for the digital age priority, this call for proposals targets investments in businesses and public administrations (notably in the part related to the innovation sector) with regards to the digital transition. Projects will unlock the potential for digital growth, deploying innovative solutions that improve accessibility and efficiency of services (both for businesses and citizens) while bridging the digital divide.</p><p>The present call for proposals under this thematic priority encourages applications in one or more or a combination of the following investment areas (non-exhaustive list):</p><p><strong>a.

In general, I3 represents an opportunity to support interregional portfolios of companies\u2019 investments bringing innovation to the market at high technology readiness levels (TRL 6-9) and reshaping EU interregional value chains.</p><p>In particular, the I3 Instrument funds interregional innovation investments projects under shared smart specialisation priorities (S3) in the following thematic priorities: green transition, digital transition and smart manufacturing which take place in the S3 participating regions. Thus, the I3 Instrument will help to promote enhanced interregional connections among regional innovation ecosystem players organised around a shared smart specialisation area. It aims to use the untapped potential of investments in innovation where the public and private sectors, as well as research and business from different countries and regions, can work together. In order to accelerate market uptake of research results and stimulation of innovation, it supports companies in scaling up their ideas in the EU single market and address wider European political priorities \u2013 in particular the Green Deal and digital transition.</p><p>Consequently, the thematic priorities for the duration of the work programme for the call are (1) digital transition, (2) green transition, including climate neutrality, environmental sustainability and circular economy and (3) smart manufacturing. Specific objectives of the call are the creation of structured links between EU quadruple helix stakeholders, helping ecosystems to overcome market failures, supporting companies building interregional innovation investments, accelerating innovation and increasing the capacities of less developed regions to participate in EU value chains contributing to cohesion policy objectives.</p><p>Under this call the following strand of the I3 work programme will be implemented in 2023:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Financial and advisory support for investments in interregional innovation projects (strand 1)</li> </ul><p>The call is targeted at consortia of independent legal entities covering actors from, both, the demand and supply side of the quadruple-helix ecosystem, such as (non-exhaustive list):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Public authorities (national/regional/local)</li><li>Universities, Research and Technology organisations, Innovation agencies</li><li>Cluster organisations, SMEs, start-ups,</li><li>Research data alliances (RDA)</li><li>Any other entity that resembles the nature of the above mentioned entities.</li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 17, 2023 5:17:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 17, 2023 5:17:47 PM", "content": "<p>27&nbsp;proposals were submitted by the deadline of 17/10/2023 at 17h00, CET.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 26, 2023 3:16:35 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 26, 2023 3:16:35 PM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: I3-2023-INV1(I3-PJG)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The call document has been updated.
