Applicants shall explain and demonstrate how their proposals are aligned with the respective EU policies and with the documents published by the European Commission. The degree of relevance to the priorities of the call for proposals will be assessed under the relevance award criterion.</p><p>Priority shall be given to the following actions in particular: </p><ol level=\"0\">  <li> <p><strong>Prevention of radicalisation in prisons</strong>, in particular concerning:</p>   <ul level=\"1\">    <li> <p>choice and organisation of prison regimes to prevent radicalisation (e.g. how inmates are housed, whether they are segregated from or integrated into the general prison population);</p> </li>    <li> <p>development of de-radicalisation, disengagement and rehabilitation programmes to be used in prison;</p> </li>    <li> <p>role of religious/ethical/moral counselling of inmates to help creating a counter narrative and to promote and provide support for individual de-radicalisation processes;</p> </li>    <li> <p>development of tools providing assistance of prison staff dealing with radicalised offenders.</p> </li>   </ul> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Promotion of alternatives to detention and exploration of the role of probation</strong> at EU level in the fight against radicalisation leading to violent extremism, in particular concerning development of de-radicalisation, disengagement and rehabilitation programmes which could be used outside the prison context (e.g. during criminal proceedings as a condition to drop prosecution before a court, as a condition to release from pre-trial detention, as a condition for a suspended prison sentence, as part of a prison sentence or in case of conditional release).</p> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Development of risk assessment methodologies</strong> which could be used by prison administrations and judges and prosecutors (e.g. how to detect signs of radicalisation, how to distinguish between different types of terrorist suspects and their motivations, how to collaborate with law enforcement authorities, intelligence services and probation services in this respect).</p> </li>  <li>The role of <strong>juvenile justice</strong> systems in the counter-terrorism context.</li> </ol><p>The cooperation between prosecutors of different Member States for the application of certain judicial cooperation instruments on issues related to counter terrorism and organised crime will be covered by JUST/2015/JCOO/AF/CRIM call.</p><p><strong><u>Activities</u> </strong></p><p>This topic will fund activities on: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>analytical activities, such as data collection, surveys, research activities, etc;</p> </li>  <li> <p>exchange of information and networking between judicial and administrative authorities and the legal professions and relevant civil society actors, such as development of an accessible and comprehensive source of country specific information and guidance on procedures, criminal codes, offences and legislation in each Member State;</p> </li>  <li> <p>mutual learning, identifying and exchange of best practices which may be transferable to other participating countries;</p> </li>  <li> <p>dissemination and awareness raising activities.</p> </li> </ul><p>Training activities can also be funded under this call,
