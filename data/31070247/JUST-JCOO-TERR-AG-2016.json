Proposed actions should ideally build on or replicate existing successful programmes and models for this purpose while being adapted to national or local circumstances and the needs of the individuals involved. The projects could include one or a combination of (but not be limited to) the following elements:</p><p><em>- </em>developing risk assessment tools and tools to detect early signs of radicalisation among detainees, and strengthening information sharing between prison administrations and the various actors in the criminal justice chain;</p><p>- involvement and training of religious representatives in prisons, social workers and counsellors;</p><p>- enabling a secure prison environment to operate effective rehabilitation and reintegration programmes to avoid any risks of radicalisation or recruitment to terrorist groups, with due attention to the level of respect and interactions between prison staff and detainees;</p><p>- preparation of release, and programmes during probation or post-release, to promote reintegration of individuals at risk of radicalisation or willing to disengage;</p><p>- development of a multi-agency approach for the efficient implementation and follow-up of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes;</p><p>- evaluation of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes in prisons (new or existing).</p><p>2. <em>Risk assessment tools for the judiciary. </em>The Council Conclusions, mentioned above, call on Member States to consider alternative or additional measures to prevent, as far as possible, radicalisation and terrorist recruitment in prisons. Such measures may include, where appropriate, alternative or additional measures to prosecution and/or detention in all stages of the procedure, among which rehabilitation, including as a condition for probation or suspension of prison sentences. To enable national judicial authorities to determine such appropriate measures, proposed actions should develop risk assessment tools, which should be based on an individual approach and include the possibility to re-evaluate the risk at regular intervals, while taking due account of security and public safety concerns. Actions could also include one or a combination of (but not be limited to) the following elements:</p><p>- Putting developed risk assessment tools (new or existing) in practical use, preferably in a multi-disciplinary and holistic way, including, where appropriate, sharing of relevant information between law enforcement, security services and prosecution and, where applicable, with local authorities and social workers; this could be done by setting up multi-disciplinary bodies or working methods or otherwise ensuring that the follow-up of the cases is done in an integrated way.</p><p>- Evaluation of risk assessment tools (new or existing) and their practical use.</p><p>3. <em>Training of professionals </em>(in particular prison management and staff, probation officers, prosecutors, judiciary, prison chaplains/imams, counsellors) involved in dealing with radicalised violent extremists or those at risk of becoming radicalised, in a sustained and multi-disciplinary way. The training programmes should use and/or replicate, to the extent possible, the support, tools and materials available at EU and international level to avoid duplication and build on existing best practices. A special focus should be given to the use of risk assessment tools, implementation of de-radicalisation/disengagement/rehabilitation programmes, the use of alternatives to detention, counselling and the development of counter narratives to violent radicalised ideas. Training programmes could be offered in a variety of methods (traditional courses, webinars, exchange of staff for capacity building, study visits etc.).
