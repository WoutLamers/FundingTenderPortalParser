Priorities</strong></p><p>This call aims to establish 4-year Framework Partnership Agreements with European networks whose statutory aims are to facilitate effective access to justice for all, including the promotion and protection of the rights of victims of crime and the rights of defence. The annual operating grants to be signed on the basis of these Framework Partnership Agreements will enhance the capacities of these networks to contribute actively to the development and implementation of the EU policies in this area.</p><p><strong>1.2. Description of the activities to be funded under this topic</strong></p><p>This call will support networks whose activities contribute to the implementation of the objectives of the Programme and which will implement among others: analytical activities, training activities, mutual learning, cooperation, awareness-raising and dissemination activities with EU added value.</p><p>The activities to be carried out by these networks in the given period must contribute to the understanding and the implementation of the Directives on the rights of victims<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> and on procedural rights of suspected and accused persons<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>In the field of victims 'rights, the activities to be carried out include, practical application of the relevant EU rules, notably the Victims 'Rights Directive, but also application of the EU rules related to compensation to victims and to increased protection of victims in cross-border cases. The activities should focus on exchanging of best practice, including best methods of implementation of the EU rules and on mutual learning. The overall objective should be to foster the cooperation among the Member State and among the responsible national authorities (national experts) and the relevant practitioners who come into contact with victims (including police, prosecution, judicial authorities, lawyers and support services).</p><p>In the field of procedural rights of suspected and accused persons activities of particular importance are those supporting the correct implementation of the Directive on the right of access to a lawyer and the Directives adopted in 2016. Activities could cover practical aspects of the implementation process of all procedural rights directives. They should provide guidance and outline best practices, and they should foster the cooperation between Member States to improve the rights of defence. Activities could also cover pre-trial detention (in particular the use of alternatives to detention) and other areas in the field of procedural rights, such as remedies.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Directive 2012/29/EU of 25 October 2012, OJ L 315 of 14.11.2012, p. 57-73</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>Directive 2010/64/EU of 20 October 2010, OJ L 280 of 26.10.2010, p. 1\u20137; Directive 2012/13/EU of 22 May 2012, OJ L 142 of 1.6.2012, p. 1\u201310.; Directive 2013/48/EU of 22 October 2013, OJ L 294, 6.11.2013, p. 1\u201312; Directive (EU) 2016/343 of 9 March 2019, OJ L 64, 11.3.2016, p.1-11; Directive (EU) 2016/800 of 11 May 2016, OJ L 132, 21.5.2016, p.1-20; Directive (EU) 2016/1919 of 26 October 2016, OJ L 297, p.1-8.</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/justice/guide/just-list-eligible-countries_en.pdf\">List of eligible countries</a></span></strong><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Eligibility and admissibility conditions<br />\r\n    </strong></span><br />\r\n    2.1 Admissibility requirements are described under point 1 of part C of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/common/just-rec-guide-applicants-fpa-og_en.pdf\">Guide for applicants</a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    2.2 Eligibility of the applicant and&nbsp;the application:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    (a) The applicant for the Framework Partnership must be a private non-profit-oriented organisation duly established in one of the countries participating in the Programme; <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    (b) The applicant for the Framework Partnership must be an established formal network with own legal personality or represent (as a joint secretariat or officially appointed coordinator) an established formal network, must be organised at European level and have member organisations/bodies or authorities in at least 14 participating countries.
