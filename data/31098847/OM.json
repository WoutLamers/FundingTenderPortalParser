It is also one of the sectors that were identified in the Commission's Blue Growth Communication<u> </u>as an area where EU action can complement initiatives by the Member States to help this nascent industry develop faster and establish a new industrial sector.</p><p>The Ocean Energy Strategic Roadmap \u201cBuilding Ocean Energy for Europe\u201d published in November 2016 identified de-risking environmental consenting as a key challenge. The development of fit-for-purpose, effective and efficient licensing systems for ocean energy projects across Member States is essential at this stage of development of the sector. This was further confirmed as a priority area for cooperation with member states in the SET Plan Ocean Energy implementation plan adopted by the adopted by SET plan steering committee in March 2018.</p><p>Strategic planning is necessary to prevent future conflicts with other sea users and to ensure minimal impact of ocean energy deployment on the marine environment. Early and coordinated environmental assessment procedures under applicable environmental legislations (Directives on Strategic Environmental Assessment Environmental Impact Assessment, Marine Strategy Framework, Habitats, Birds, NATURA 2000 and Maritime Spatial Planning) and the respective national legal rules are fundamental in ensuring compliance and stakeholders' involvement.</p><p>Developers\u2019 application for consent requires a sound understanding of environmental assessment and processes applied to ocean energy. However, deployments of ocean energy devices are without precedent and there is limited empirical data that could inform the regulatory process. Obtaining consent for an emerging technology such as ocean energy can be time consuming and costly. This also entails the need for public information, consultation and support. Consenting processes, thus, need to be anticipated, tailored and proportionate.</p><p>Close environmental monitoring and impact assessment and an early understanding of these aspects will benefit the current and future deployments of the ocean energy sector as a whole, by putting in place a guiding framework within which to establish protocol for regulatory assessments, licensing, control and monitoring. This will help to steer the transition from research and development to commercial deployment of new technologies.</p><p>This is the second call for proposals in this area launched with support of the EMFF.</p><p>The general objectives of this call for proposals are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To increase the amount of environmental data and improve knowledge on assessing possible impacts of ocean energy devices (wave, tidal and ocean thermal energy conversion) deployed at sea;</li><li>To contribute to reducing uncertainty in modelling potential impacts of future ocean energy devices;</li><li>To provide guidance to ocean energy developers and to public competent authorities in charge of licencing and maritime planning ;</li><li>To inform stakeholders and help feed the public debate</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Geographical scope</strong></p><p>The geographic area covered by the action includes the whole of the EU.</p><p><em>Activities outside of the EU may be included if relevant to achieving the overall and specific objectives of this call.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong>Expected outputs:</strong></p><p>Projects under this action should achieve concrete outputs within the project duration.

It is also one of the sectors that were identified in the Commission's Blue Growth Communication<u> </u>as an area where EU action can complement initiatives by the Member States to help this nascent industry develop faster and establish a new industrial sector.</p><p>The Ocean Energy Strategic Roadmap \u201cBuilding Ocean Energy for Europe\u201d published in November 2016 identified de-risking environmental consenting as a key challenge. The development of fit-for-purpose, effective and efficient licensing systems for ocean energy projects across Member States is essential at this stage of development of the sector. This was further confirmed as a priority area for cooperation with member states in the SET Plan Ocean Energy implementation plan adopted by the adopted by SET plan steering committee in March 2018.</p><p>Strategic planning is necessary to prevent future conflicts with other sea users and to ensure minimal impact of ocean energy deployment on the marine environment. Early and coordinated environmental assessment procedures under applicable environmental legislations (Directives on Strategic Environmental Assessment Environmental Impact Assessment, Marine Strategy Framework, Habitats, Birds, NATURA 2000 and Maritime Spatial Planning) and the respective national legal rules are fundamental in ensuring compliance and stakeholders' involvement.</p><p>Developers\u2019 application for consent requires a sound understanding of environmental assessment and processes applied to ocean energy. However, deployments of ocean energy devices are without precedent and there is limited empirical data that could inform the regulatory process. Obtaining consent for an emerging technology such as ocean energy can be time consuming and costly. This also entails the need for public information, consultation and support. Consenting processes, thus, need to be anticipated, tailored and proportionate.</p><p>Close environmental monitoring and impact assessment and an early understanding of these aspects will benefit the current and future deployments of the ocean energy sector as a whole, by putting in place a guiding framework within which to establish protocol for regulatory assessments, licensing, control and monitoring. This will help to steer the transition from research and development to commercial deployment of new technologies.</p><p>This is the second call for proposals in this area launched with support of the EMFF.</p>\n<p><em>This call is launched in accordance with the 2019 Work Programme<u> (1) </u>or the Implementation of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) (section 1.2.1.1 of the annex), on the basis of the objectives set out in the Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund<u> (2)</u>, and in particular Article 82(c).</em></p><p><em>\u200b(1) </em>Commission Implementing Decision C(2018) 8395 final of 13 December 2018 on the financing of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the adoption of the work programme for 2019, and its annex.</p><p>(2) Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2328/2003, (EC) No 861/2006, (EC) No 1198/2006 and (EC) No 791/2007 and Regulation (EU) No 1255/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Official Journal of the European Union, L 149/1 of 20.5.2014.</p><p><strong>\u200bBudget available:</strong></p><p>The total budget earmarked for this action is <strong>EUR 2 300 000.</strong></p><p>This budget might be increased by maximum 20%.</p><p>The EU grant is limited to a maximum co-funding rate of 80% of eligible costs actually incurred.</p><p>It is estimated that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 800,000 and EUR 1,500,000 would allow the objectives of this call for proposals to be addressed appropriately.
