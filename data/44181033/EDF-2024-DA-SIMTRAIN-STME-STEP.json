Studies to evaluate hospital preparedness have shown that good response plans can be developed for complex medical training scenarios (such as radiation exposure response), and that medical providers can be trained to follow these plans if the given training is realistic in its delivery.</p><p>Effective military medical training and readiness for PFC require decision training, performance of individual medical procedures and excellent teamwork skills in austere conditions of fast changing battlefield conditions of large-scale symmetrical conflict or natural disaster. Military medical training based on both computer-generated, hybrid and physical teaching materials creates advantage to development of cost-effective training courses for the military and civilian medical (support) personnel population and paramedics.</p><p>European Union has already started its efforts for developing military medics\u2019 innovative training solutions, focused on Field Care and Role 1 scenarios. In order to take full advantage of military medics training simulation, additional operational scenarios and functionalities in a virtual reality environment have to be developed and integrated into a network of federated toolbox which provides interconnection and joint access to simulation systems that are supporting different but mutually complementing simulation methods like mixed, augmented, hybrid, part task trainers, logistics, manikins and medical equipment, but currently are unevenly distributed in the European market for the medical personnel and paramedic training.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The topic aims to address the current operational challenges facing military medical personnel in the EU Member States (MS) and EDF Associated Countries, including in and out of areas of deployment.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals must address the development of a prototyped solution for a federation of available and enhanced medical simulation systems that support military medical curriculum and are connected to a (at best AI-based) feedback system (that may include real medical and health-data as benchmarking) that enables to see integrated picture of all training related information.</p><p>Proposals must therefore address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Medical Training Modules</strong>: The Medical Training Modules are designed to impart knowledge in military medicine to trainees. At present, the guidelines are anchored in Tactical Combat Casualty Care, serving as vital training curricula for both medical and non-medical personnel in civilian and military contexts. Looking ahead to future battlefield situations, insights from Ukraine underscore the importance of updating existing guidelines with a Prolonged Casualty Care environments. This adaptation is essential in preparing Europeans to confront diverse battlefield scenarios. Training modules can provide realistic, scenario-based learning experiences covering trauma, infections, and radiation exposure. They extend across various environments, including battlefield tranches, vehicles, and aircraft, offering comprehensive multi-modal and interdisciplinary training. The integration of virtual and mixed technologies elevates the delivery of educational content and learning retention. The overarching focus is effective communication, coordination, and preparedness for non-medical professionals in dynamic settings of the battlefield.</li><li><strong>Supporting elements enabling Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network</strong>: The Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network employs advanced technologies to create a comprehensive and realistic training environment. This includes cloud-based solutions for simultaneous management of large casualties, integration of digital computer simulated casualties for dynamic scenarios, physical simulated patients for hands-on training, and physical manikin systems replicating human responses. Crucially, seamless data exchange between computer-generated simulations and physical systems ensures a cohesive training experience. The interconnected federated network allows collaborative exercises across different locations, with real-time monitoring and feedback enhancing the learning process. Scalability, customisation, and integration of virtual, mixed, and augmented reality technologies contribute to an immersive and adaptable training platform for military non-medical and medical professionals.</li><li><strong>Integration with Real World</strong>: The integration of 5G technology into medical education signifies a transformative approach for European Union medical training centres. This integration facilitates the delivery of educational content with high-speed, low-latency connectivity, enabling real-time and immersive learning experiences. Learning analytics tools add a data-driven dimension, offering insights into individual and collective learning patterns. Augmented reality serves as a powerful teaching aid, particularly for Definitive Surgical Trauma Care, enhancing trainees' understanding through virtual overlays in the real-world environment. This comprehensive integration fosters scalable and distributed training solutions, promotes remote collaboration, and ensures standardisation and quality assurance across diverse training centres.
