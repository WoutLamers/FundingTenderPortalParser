In order to meet these requirements in the area of structures and construction methods, modular and multi-material designs or the integration of functions are considered as particularly promising. For example, the combination of different materials such as fibre composites and metals shows a very high potential for performance enhancement with simultaneous economic and environmental advantages. To exploit the potential of such new material technologies in military systems, suitable, high-performance and technically mature joining technologies are required. Additionally, new sensorised materials might enable new certification procedures for joining technologies.</p><p>Given the harsh environment in which military systems have to operate and the increase risk of damage during operation, the operability and survivability of platforms depend on fast, efficient and reliable repair methods. The advantages of new materials technologies can only be fully exploited if adequate repair technologies are available and could, ideally, be used in the field.</p><p>Due to the complexity of today\u2019s systems not only the procurement is capital-intensive but the maintenance also generates considerable costs and the need for significant logistic support. Developing new methods that can decrease the effort to fulfil the operational needs without any negative effect on safety will result in advantage for both civil and military operators. Advances in repair and maintenance technologies will also reduce the environmental footprint of defence equipment. An example for new concepts of maintenance, are technologies involving the use of in-structure or on-structure health monitoring sensors, such as those addressed by the call EDF-2021-NAVAL-R-SSHM. To make such concepts useable for future military systems they need to be matured, repair and maintenance aspects should be taken into account and most importantly, the technologies need to be tested and qualified.</p><p>There are several technologies under development in national and European projects addressing the area of maintenance, joining and repair. Research and Development projects often lead to a technology readiness level (TRL) of approximatively 4, meaning that new technologies show potential for use in future military applications and have been validated in a lab. However, these technologies have not yet been tested at demonstrator level (TRL 6/7) and therefore cannot yet be considered useable in military products. The gap between technological proof-of-concept and (at least partially) qualified solutions is often difficult to overcome for innovative solutions. New sources of funding must be found, as further maturation efforts can often not be covered by research funding. At the same time, connections must be established with certification entities, planned defence projects and potential end users, often still unaware of the new technological opportunities. Because of these challenges, summarised as \u2018valley-of-death\u2019, new defence products are often delayed in their transfer into new defence products or even abandoned, although the technologies show large potential for future applications. Specific support to overcome the valley-of-death will enable the use of (partially) qualified and certified technologies in next generation military systems to produce, operate and maintain them at a fraction of cost of current systems.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic will provide support to collaborative development activities to setup demonstrator platforms and test candidate technologies for maintenance, joining and repair, in order to propel those technologies\u2019 maturity and allow them to be approved and/or qualified.</p><p>There will only be a limited number of innovative technologies directly available within a selected consortium. Therefore, the consortium will be requested to reach out to third parties across the EU and EDF associated countries, in particular SMEs, including start-ups, to test a broad spectrum of technological solutions and give those innovative players the opportunity to demonstrate the potential of their ideas to relevant players in the defence application field. As a tool to enable this open innovation approach, funding for financial support to third parties (FSTP) will be integral part of the awarded grant. The consortium will be required to organise calls to third parties to select and award start-ups and SMEs. The selected third parties will be offered the opportunity and financial support to test their solutions, receive technical mentoring and other relevant acceleration services for a specific time period.</p><p>Therefore, the specific objective of this topic is twofold. The first is the development of a new test environment for testing and the improvement of technologies up to certification level. The second is the creation of a cross-border defence innovation network that encompasses players that would otherwise not have the means to access EDF actions, thereby further enhancing innovation capacity and competitiveness of the European Defence Industrial and Technological Base.</p><p>The consortia responding to the call may include a large variety of entities, such as military or civil test centres, research institutes, universities, industry, certification authorities, accelerators or incubators as well as other organisations that can play a role in the establishment or certification of new technologies for repair, joining and maintenance or that can support the associated innovation support measures targeted towards third parties receiving financial support.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic aims at supporting the technological maturation of various joining or repair or maintenance technologies, including the associated processes.</p><p>The proposals must address the setup of a suitable demonstrator platform as a test environment which offers the possibility to test, qualify and certify technologies covering the fields of joining, repair and maintenance. This may include the establishment of adequate test protocols. The platform may be focussing on one of the defence application domains air, land or naval or the combination of land and naval domains. The demonstrator platform should be a generic system suitable for this domain (e.g. a plane, a ship, a truck, etc.). The proposals may involve the set-up of a new platform or the partial modification of existing systems to be used as a demonstrator platform, e.g. by replacing individual parts and components or by integrating additional functions, sensors, etc. In addition, various parts or components may be manufactured multiple times to cover different technologies.</p><p>The proposals must test various joining or repair or maintenance technologies or combination of them. The considered technologies should have reached the stage of experimental proof-of-concept (TRL 3) or, preferably laboratory validation (TRL 4) but may also have been already validated in a relevant environment (TRL 5). The proposals must address the technological maturity of promising technologies to lead them towards qualification and certification. This must encompass all tests and approvals to achieve the demonstration of the technology in a relevant or operational environment (TRL 6 or 7). The considered technologies must encompass technologies that are not available within the consortium. Technologies must be relevant for military applications but may include technologies originally developed for civil applications. Technologies adequate for \u2018in-field\u2019 repairs should be considered.</p><p>The proposals must describe how entities with expertise on the relevant technologies know-how will be supported, including the proposed implementation conditions for FSTP. Beneficiaries of FSTP that contribute with a joining or repair or maintenance technology must receive financial support to prepare a sample of their technology, to attend and support the testing of their technological sample, and to technologically improve their solution. FSTP may also be provided to entities that contribute with analysis and measurement capacities, technology-specific expertise, innovative tools, or support the manufacturing of technology test samples or components necessary for testing. The proposals must include technical mentoring for the selected beneficiaries of the FSTP as well as the set-up of additional measures to support the beneficiaries\u2019 business case.</p><p>Although the proposals may consider joining and repair technologies that are applicable and involve the use of additive manufacturing processed parts, the proposals must not focus on the improvement of additive manufacturing processes themselves, as those are covered by the call EDF-2021-DIS-RDIS-AMD. The proposals may not target minor improvements of technologies not having achieved a proof-of-concept (below TRL 3).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table
