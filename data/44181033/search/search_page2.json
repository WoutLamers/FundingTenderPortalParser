The performance and life-cycle cost of defence platforms and equipment directly depend on the materials properties of the solutions available for their manufacturing. In particular, the resistance to high temperatures is an important feature for use in specific environments or for components that need to withstand high thermal loads due to their functionality. At the same time, future materials and structural solutions should exhibit low weight and keep the same material performances necessary for specific defence applications.</p><p>Furthermore, in addition to the physical and chemical required properties of the materials themselves, there are challenges related to availability, production, processing, export control and environmental concerns which also need to be taken into account.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Defence applications require the investigation and improvement of materials that are able to withstand hypersonic flight, extreme thermal loads, ballistic loads, electromagnetic pulse, etc.</p><p>The development of material solutions for civil applications is a broad and dynamic technological field. Temperature resistance and weight reduction are aspects of interest for civil applications also and R&amp;D efforts in this regard regularly result in new materials, design, structures, processes or standards that improve material performance. However, due to the harsh and particular conditions of defence-related use-cases, civil technologies need to be adapted, further improved or combined with defence-specific technologies through additional R&amp;D efforts to make them suitable for defence applications.</p><p>The capacity to withstand high temperatures is a particularly important characteristic for materials used in many defence applications. Parts of aircraft, both airplanes and helicopters, especially close to the engine, need to yield the necessary temperature resistance, weight and structural characteristics. Concerning ground systems, components withstanding high temperatures do not only need to have acceptable weight but should also demonstrate good ballistic performance, for example to gain protection against kinetic energy penetrators. For missile, air and space applications, materials need to reach the state of the art in terms of lightness, structural strength as well as withstanding extreme thermal loads (e.g. typical of hypersonic flight). High temperature materials used for naval applications need to additionally be protected against salty water corrosion or other types of corrosion but also to save weight by reducing insulation or to enhance heat resistance. Sensor systems need materials that exhibit transparency in spectral band suitable for their function, such as visual frequencies, near infrared, radiofrequencies or others, while maintaining mechanical properties in terms of hardness and temperature resistance.</p><p>All of these application examples will additionally benefit from materials that feature a certain level of protection against effects of electromagnetic pulse and contribute to ensuring electromagnetic compatibility.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Several key components and structural parts of defence systems are subject to extreme conditions (like high temperatures, ballistic impact or explosions), often in combination with harsh conditions in terms of stress, chemical environment, etc. In these conditions, material properties at high temperatures and/or when subject to high velocity impact represent a limiting factor for the performance of the system as a whole. In addition, for some applications, the critical components consist of or are protected by insulation materials. This leads to a considerable increase in total weight and a significant rise in material costs.</p><p>The proposals must focus on design and/or adaptation of high performance materials for future use in defence applications while achieving weight saving. The proposals must also address demonstration of material performance in a laboratory environment that recreates realistic conditions for the materials used.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

While space capacities have become strategically important to Europe\u2019s civil and commercial objectives, and are critical to ensure vital functions in military operations, the easier access to space, the growing number of space debris in orbit and the existence of counterspace capabilities and actions introduce increasing risks and threats to space assets. This implies the necessity to protect European space assets in their outer space environment.</p><p>Protection can be achieved by active and passive measures. This includes steps such as anti-jamming protection and other on-board countermeasures. It also includes means to characterise and attribute actions and effects of adversaries to enable satellite operators to restore functions, capabilities, or capacities after a human-made space incident.</p><p>Passive protection allows the detection and the characterisation of any attempt and action considered as hostile in order to limit the effects or to propose a counter action.</p><p>Considering the increasing threats and hazards towards space-based capabilities, technologies for passive protection of space assets should be developed for a better efficiency, safety and resilience of core missions. Such technologies should in particular address local detection, identification and characterisation of threats and protection mechanisms (including manoeuvres) with a focus on the capability to complement ground-based observations by leveraging on the use of space-based sensors.</p><p><strong><em>General objective</em></strong></p><p>The general objective of this topic is to conduct research activities on space-based technologies contributing to the protection of space-based assets against a wide range of threats and to demonstrate the feasibility of selected technological solutions.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objectives of this topic are to identify and consolidate the potential threats to space assets and an overall preliminary system layout with associated functional chains of the different components (open architecture with interfaces and the possibility to integrate other and legacy systems), to study and select the best promising technologies to counter such threats based on this overall preliminary system layout, and to elaborate the associated technological roadmap as well as to start its implementation on some technological blocks.</p><p>In addition, this topic aims at studying the repartition of functionalities between ground- and space-based components to achieve an effective protection of the space assets, taking into account the interfaces with a wider space surveillance network for military space situational awareness: e.g. repartition of the sensors (on-board \u2013 as a primary or secondary sensor \u2013 or on the ground) and an overall preliminary system layout linked to a command and control (C2) approach to gather data and then elaborate a common operational picture of threats.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The proposals must address the identification and consolidation of the main threats against generic space assets and associated vulnerabilities, the identification of technical solutions or adaptation of procedures to counter these threats, as well as the definition of the overall preliminary architecture for the elaboration of a comprehensive approach (satellite, C2 and system layout) to deal with these threats. </p><p>The proposals must consider at least the following threats:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>interference, uplink and downlink jamming and spoofing;</li><li>electromagnetic pulse attacks, high-energy lasers and high-powered microwave weapons;</li><li>physical attacks (e.g. threatening objects coming from intended space debris generation, as well as co-orbital and ground based anti-satellite weapons (ASAT)).</li> </ul><p>The proposals must consider technologies contributing:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>to the detection and identification of the threats, including, but not limited to, anti-satellite weapons and space objects with unexpected behaviour, using data processing for space applications and spectral signature;</li><li>and to the protection of the space assets;</li> </ul><p>such as:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>passive or active optical sensors, radar sensors, on-board processing for proximity surveillance and tracking, including AI-based on-board elaboration for high-level actionable information extraction from measurements to support autonomous decision-making and manoeuver;</li><li>manoeuvrability to protect platform and payload, including technologies for instantaneous, rapid and agile evasive manoeuvres to escape objects that carry out suspicious/attacking proximity manoeuvres;</li><li>technologies to protect satellite communication resources and C2 activities access from unwanted usage;</li><li>electronic support measures (ESM) sensors for space assets;</li><li>protection against high-energy laser, electromagnetic pulse attack and high-power microwave (HPM) weapons;</li><li>technologies allowing various level of autonomy and generation of pre-processed information for data volume reduction during transmission to ground.</li> </ul><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcomes should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Prepare 2035/2040+ horizon, building European capabilities for new EU/NATO rotorcraft/VTOL programmes, fully compatible to future multi-domain combat collaborative systems.</li><li>Develop technologies and concepts usable for upgrade of legacy platforms, where applicable.</li><li>Support the competitiveness and excellence of the EDTIB, as well as the autonomy and sovereignty of EU and EDF Associated Countries, in the field of military rotorcraft.</li><li>Increase the effectiveness and efficiency of EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries Armed Forces.</li><li>Enhance the strategic autonomy and competitiveness of the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries and their DTIB willing and able to develop new technologies for inclusion in future EU/NATO rotorcraft programmes.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The importance of rotorcraft in military operations is widely recognised as one of the most important VTOL assets/systems. Military rotorcraft act like workhorses of the battlefield, performing a variety of missions such as armed reconnaissance, strike, combat, combat and ordinary search-and-rescue (SAR), MEDical EVACuation (MEDEVAC), CASualty EVACuation (CASEVAC), utility, air assault and close aerial support, all of which are critical to the success of military operations.</p><p>After decades of European involvement in counter-insurgency type of operations, recent conflicts have marked the return of high-intensity confrontations very close to European Union territory, recalling that although military helicopters are key assets, they require careful mission planning and operations to be efficient and survivable.</p><p>On the longer term, rotorcraft is foreseen to be even more critical as future combat theatres are likely to take place in congested urban environment, mostly in littoral regions, and to involve a wide range of long-range strike capabilities (artillery, short range ballistic missiles) combined with a shortened OODA loop made possible by the massive global deployment of networked C4ISR assets.</p><p>Current capability forecast assessments at European and NATO levels show that the helicopter fleets will have to be renewed as of 2035-2040. The main objective is therefore to provide the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries with a European solution that meets the European market and military needs in the field of rotorcraft.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic is intended to lead to a step improvement in EU VTOL capability with a view to future EU/NATO rotorcraft programmes (EIS 2035/2040+). Moreover, developed technologies should also be used for upgrades of legacy platforms, where applicable.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address future

relevant situational awareness across all domains. They also need to be able to both operate cross-domain capabilities, such as any-sensor-to-any-shooter networking, and prevent the enemy from doing so. This requires communications systems that can perform ad hoc networking in all domains in dynamically evolving tactical situations. Currently, this is done with mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) data links.</p><p>As wireless solutions such as the Internet of Battlefield Things proliferate, the electromagnetic spectrum is likely to become an increasingly important source of situational awareness. Passive electronic monitoring, detection, classification and localisation of enemy radio frequency emitters is part of the recognised situational picture. Traditionally, this has been the task of electronic warfare (EW) units and their specific equipment providing electronic support (ES) to combat units.</p><p>To counter a detected threat, forces can use kinetic- (KE) and directed-energy (DE) means with their weapon systems, or electronic protection (EP) and attack (EA) if they have jamming systems, traditionally equipment carried and used by dedicated EW units. Before directing fire at detected targets, soldiers must mitigate the risk of friendly fire. At long ranges and in poor visibility, this requires radio communications with either self-positioning based Blue Force Tracking (BFT) or interrogation-based Identification Friend or Foe (IFF).</p><p>Today, MANET data links, ES receivers, jammers, BFT and IFF are separate pieces of equipment requiring decentralised control, separate installation space, power supply, cabling, antennas, etc. By combining these functionalities into a single autonomously controlled equipment, it would be possible to achieve better performance, higher reliability, lower weight and lower life cycle costs.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned technological reasons for converged aperture, there is also a need for converged systems. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is expected to continue to be contested, congested and constrained. Military use of the EMS is under serious pressure from the civil community. Civilian, dual-use and military applications intermingle in the EMS currently in use, challenging the freedom and security of operation (OPSEC) of military users. With Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, systems are likely to be able to dynamically perform mission and threat analysis, situational awareness, positioning and navigation, and jamming. This means dynamic adaptation to prevailing conditions at machine speed. This would require AI-based operation at the device and system of systems (fleet/network) level in order to coordinate actions of several systems with minimal detectability and platform losses.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to design, develop and build a system that should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Accelerate command and control (C2) and enhance operational effectiveness by providing cross-domain mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities to the armed forces.</li><li>Increase lethality by enabling faster firing and reducing the risk of collateral damages, including fratricide, by providing the means to detect and target the enemy and to locate, track and identify friendly forces.</li><li>Reduce enemy lethality and increase own protection by avoiding detection with AI-based emission control, stealthy waveforms and by jamming enemy communications.</li><li>Provide autonomous mission management of several systems (including detection, jamming and targeting) within the network in order to improve survivability, and autonomously take actions to meet the mission objectives with the aid of AI.</li><li>Be capable of operating in all weather conditions, in particular in the challenging Arctic environment and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied areas.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address study, development and qualification of new generation scalable and cognitive (AI-controlled) multifunctional software defined (SD) transceiver for military use in manned and unmanned platforms. The ultimate objective of the proposals must be to achieve a qualified prototype for end-user demonstrations with a view to obtain end-user commitment for operational use.</p><p>Proposals may also provide a framework for the development of new standards, including proposals for intelligent and effective spectrum management, and prepare to contribute to future standards. The design approach should focus on building a system capable for series production and scalable for product families.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome is expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Create a European ecosystem for secured 5G devices and infrastructures, including hybrid networks (utilising both civilian and military radio technologies), configuration and management tools and cyber security fit for military use.</li><li>Prepare the ground for the use in defence operations of next generation communication standards (e.g., 6G).</li><li>Demonstrate the adaption of an appropriate industry standard to military needs.</li><li>Orchestrate services across multiple administrative domains through the concept of federation.</li><li>Provide worldwide 5G connectivity for operations through the integration of NTN.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>5G is a technology originally developed to address the ongoing rapid pace of digital transformation of the different vertical industries in the civilian world. It is continuously being developed through standardisation activities in 3GPP, and new releases with extended features of the standard are approved approximately every 18 to 24 months.</p><p>To ensure a technological edge in military use of 5G, it is important to capitalise on the continued momentum of new releases and associated features relevant for military operations. In 2016, resilience in civil communication systems was listed by NATO as one of seven baseline requirements that each Member State should measure their level of preparedness. In November 2019, this requirement was updated by NATO Defence Ministers, who stressed the need for reliable communications including 5G.</p><p>To address this statement and ensure a higher degree of robustness and resilience in military operations when operating in the tactical edge, the militaries should be able to exploit and seamlessly interact with civilian infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted services for tactical command and control applications.</p><p>This topic focuses on system level integration and orchestration of 5G technologies for seamless interaction of private military and public 5G networks. Hence, the overall objective is to support the need for an always connected concept enabling military applications to roam securely through a mix of private and public networks. To achieve this, there is a need to study, develop and demonstrate how the military can exploit seamless and uninterrupted transfer of secure applications and services in a coverage area served by a mix of private military and public 5G networks, including BLoS (Beyond Line of Sight) through Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) communication systems integrated in 3GPP standard.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific challenge of this topic is to demonstrate robust and dynamic operational capabilities of 5G connectivity solutions matching the military needs for tactical command and control applications and services.</p><p>The solution should always be connected via a hybrid form of networks, while ensuring secure communications, using tactical networks, private military and public 5G networks and other federation solutions. The use of flexible reach back solutions such as 5G NTN is also necessary to reach shared centralised cloud services.</p><p>Within this context, secure integration of commercial and military hardware, software and services is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed on both a technological and a commercial level.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of either integrated private-public 5G system architectures for military operations, or private military 5G networks, or public 5G services for military applications.</p><p>Moreover, proposals should lead to the development and demonstration of case-agnostic technical products and services, applicable to military operations across all dimensions of warfare. The demonstrations should be performed in relevant operational environments and cover all aspects from devices, infrastructure, security, and simplified orchestration of the overall system.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>European sovereignty for ISR platforms.</li><li>The emergence of a certifiable and air traffic integrated European MALE RPAS.</li><li>Improve interoperability of EU Member States Armed Forces.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The \u2018Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System\u2019 (MALE RPAS) is an indispensable capability to facilitate international conflict prevention and crisis management in all phases of operations \u2013 especially in the field of Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). Member States and EDF Associated Countries (MS) have already used various types of MALE RPAS in recent operations to provide detection, identification and communication. MALE RPAS could also have a dual use potential.</p><p>The EU commonly agreed priorities underline the permanent need to track ships, aircraft and other systems across a wide area of airspace by means of interoperable unmanned surveillance systems capable of operating in all and adverse weather conditions and all types of environments, with assured data integrity. To operate in all types of operational environments, RPAS must be integrated into air traffic management (ATM).</p><p>As part of a versatile and robust MALE RPAS, the system should consider the option to incorporate the means for an effective neutralisation of targets that posed a threat to the mission being carried out.</p><p>Today, most of the ISR capabilities of the MS rely on non-EU manufacturers in order to carry out their missions. However, due to the sensitive nature of military operations and the restrictions on technology transfer that prevent MS and EDF Associated Countries from fully benefiting from platform adaptation, the development of a fully European MALE RPAS is key to reduce dependency on non-EU solutions and to ensure sovereignty in this area of ISTAR.</p><p>It is an overarching objective to strengthen European sovereignty in this strategically relevant area. Hence, this topic is expected to result in a step-changing programme in line with the commonly agreed EU defence objectives and ensuring European strategic autonomy and technological competitiveness in a broad sense.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>MALE RPAS reconnaissance includes optical, infrared, radar and signal intelligence sensors and generates geoinformation data. The sensors for optical, infrared and radar reconnaissance are usual configuration parts of a MALE system. As signal intelligence is often classified for national eyes only, it would be preferable to develop a common pod design, which is suitable to contain the national electronics. The integration effort into the MALE system can be shared with a common pod design. This pod design is also a suitable baseline for additional future sensors.</p><p>The ultimate objective is to develop, produce and sustain a system that provides this critical defence capability to respond to future security challenges.</p><p>In addition, a strong European supply chain is intended to be developed at all levels to promote the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in the long term. The supply chain should not be a pre-determined black box, but is expected to be open to competitive suppliers in a largely open tendering process, with the suppliers for mission-critical or security-relevant systems intended to be EU-based.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address a prototype of a fully European MALE RPAS with an innovative ISTAR and armed ISTAR capability to exceed the capabilities of comparable current systems and the capabilities of systems available at the entry into service time or, at least, be comparable with them. The prototype must be tested with a view to further qualification and certification activities.</p><p>Proposals must also address the design and prototype of a common sensor pod for the European MALE RPAS, without affecting the timeline of ongoing activities related to the development of MALE RPAS.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the enhancement of a multi-role approach for the MALE RPAS available with different sensor pod configurations.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic,

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome is expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>The emergence of a commonly agreed EU standard for small UAS to allow a wider European application, interchangeability of sensors and modules, together with adaptability to various types of missions.</li><li>Define commonly agreed EU defence requirements for small UAS.</li><li>Reduce the current dependencies on non-European UAS suppliers.</li><li>Reduce the fragmentation of UAS fleets in European armed forces and reduce the procurement and maintenance costs through economies of scale.</li><li>Promote the interoperability between European armed forces.</li><li>Foster an active European market for the development of interoperable and interchangeable sensors.</li><li>Exploit the synergy with other than defence applications.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Despite the extensive use of COTS UAS in recent conflicts and continued technological development, these systems serve the purpose of rapid and relatively low-cost deployment of assets and effectors in times of extreme need. As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.</p><p>Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.</p><p>Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime). In addition, the outcome of this topic is also expected to improve the intervention capacity of relevant national or European agencies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>In particular, this topic intends to contribute to address the following specific challenges that small UAS are prone to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Low UAS signatures and extended operational ranges;</li><li>Operate autonomously and automatic, including with assisted piloting considerations;</li><li>Miniaturisation of sensors and payloads, including potential weapons and communication systems;</li><li>Operational capability and survivability in contested, congested and challenging (e.g., weather) airspace.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of a small UAS with advanced ISTAR capabilities, such as real-time imagery intelligence, and possibly kinetic capabilities, capable of operating in support of the widest possible range of military operations.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the development of a multi-role approach that explores compatibility between different payloads and configurations, in particular through an Interoperable Modular and Scalable Architecture (IMOSA) approach to allow interchangeability of components and interoperability between different solutions, including a \u201cplug and play\u201d capability for sensors and possible effectors.</p><p>As the small UAS cannot support sets of different sensors due to weight, space and power limitations, the possibility of standard interfaces should be explored to allow the selection and integration of a variety of specific sensors to be used in different configurations depending on the mission, and to facilitate the use in defence, civil and dual-use configurations.</p><p>In addition, proposals may also address the potential synergy for use by law enforcement and other governmental use.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome is expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>The emergence of a commonly agreed EU standard for small UAS to allow a wider European application, interchangeability of sensors and modules, together with adaptability to various types of missions.</li><li>Define commonly agreed EU defence requirements for small UAS.</li><li>Reduce the current dependencies on non-European UAS suppliers.</li><li>Reduce the fragmentation of UAS fleets in European armed forces and reduce the procurement and maintenance costs through economies of scale.</li><li>Promote the interoperability between European armed forces.</li><li>Foster an active European market for the development of interoperable and interchangeable sensors.</li><li>Exploit the synergy with other than defence applications.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Despite the extensive use of COTS UAS in recent conflicts and continued technological development, these systems serve the purpose of rapid and relatively low-cost deployment of assets and effectors in times of extreme need. As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.</p><p>Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.</p><p>Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime). In addition, the outcome of this topic is also expected to improve the intervention capacity of relevant national or European agencies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>In particular, this topic intends to contribute to address the following specific challenges that small UAS are prone to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Low UAS signatures and extended operational ranges;</li><li>Operate autonomously and automatic, including with assisted piloting considerations;</li><li>Miniaturisation of sensors and payloads, including potential weapons and communication systems;</li><li>Operational capability and survivability in contested, congested and challenging (e.g., weather) airspace.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of a small UAS with advanced ISTAR capabilities, such as real-time imagery intelligence, and possibly kinetic capabilities, capable of operating in support of the widest possible range of military operations.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the development of a multi-role approach that explores compatibility between different payloads and configurations, in particular through an Interoperable Modular and Scalable Architecture (IMOSA) approach to allow interchangeability of components and interoperability between different solutions, including a \u201cplug and play\u201d capability for sensors and possible effectors.</p><p>As the small UAS cannot support sets of different sensors due to weight, space and power limitations, the possibility of standard interfaces should be explored to allow the selection and integration of a variety of specific sensors to be used in different configurations depending on the mission, and to facilitate the use in defence, civil and dual-use configurations.</p><p>In addition, proposals may also address the potential synergy for use by law enforcement and other governmental use.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

capability;</li><li>Automated delivery of cargo;</li><li>Beacon capability for discoverability.</li>   </ul> </li><li><strong>Miniaturised weaponry</strong>: The development of miniaturised weapons may be considered to eventually get weapon-capable small UAS, hence paving the way for a solution to develop small kinetic capability against e.g., lightly armoured targets, including e.g., loitering munitions, small calibre guided missiles and small calibre torpedoes.</li><li><strong>CBRN</strong><strong> surveillance</strong>: The developed small UAS may be able to have a standoff or remote CBRN detector as a payload to allow remote detection of CBRN threats, alerting the unit to the proximity of a contaminated threat and allowing time to take protective action.</li> </ul>"], "identifier":

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Strategic autonomy of EDTIB in the area of cooperative cyber ranges.   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Fostering the technological cooperation of industries in the

actors;</li><li>Common requirements and harmonisation of capability development.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Cyber range technologies have seen notable uptake over the last decade. They form a cornerstone of cyber defence training and testing. The objective of this topic is to take further the ongoing cyber range technology roadmap by designing and implementing next-generation solutions. The key consideration is on the cooperative approach in developing and using those cyber range technologies, thereby facilitating joint capability development.</p><p>Technological investments and developments have so far mostly focused on various fundamental needs such as visualisation, scoring, realistic scenarios, and federation. Separate mature technological building blocks exist in modern cyber and IT solutions. However, these developments have yet to be consolidated into the context of cyber ranges for defence purposes, in a manner such as the PESCO project <em>Cyber Ranges Federation</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to address the remaining challenge on design and development of solutions that deliver notable progress vis-\u00e0-vis the current state-of-the-art, including in view of wider technology landscape. This means that focus has to shift from creating cyber ranges that fulfil basic needs to cyber ranges that target next-level capability requirements. Therefore, the specific objective is about the use of cyber ranges for trainings and exercises. The proposed solutions, however, can benefit also other cyber range use-cases such as product development and penetration testing. Therefore, considerations of such use-cases may be taken into account for developing the solutions.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The next-generation cooperative cyber range capability must address at least the following issues:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises with classified information, especially for cross-border exercises by EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. </strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>Although the use of classified information in national exercises and trainings is not a new phenomenon, it is, firstly, still absent from the capabilities of many nations and, secondly, there is no existing solution that offers an EU-wide, cross-border classified capability. Such a capability could help various countries in using this functionality which they otherwise would not be able to use and it would provide a currently unavailable solution to conducting exercises across nations, including for topics such as information sharing and ensuring confidentiality of related data. This would also benefit the EU\u2019s military structure, e.g., EU Military Staff, European Defence Agency and others.</p><p>Moreover, such a capability can be used by nations internally, e.g., for its different security agencies both in defence and national security to increase interoperability.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises covering the entire chain of cyber defence operations from planning through conduct up to review, including by utilising realistic mission networks. </strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>Most large-scale technical cyber exercises that are currently conducted do not sufficiently cover all relevant aspects of cyberspace operations. While such aspects are sometimes covered in non-technical exercises, these tend to not sufficiently well incorporate technical cyber defence teams. As a result, truly comprehensive and effective exercises are difficult to deliver.</p><p>The aspects that surround these technical activities (e.g., operation planning, legal considerations) and which complement incident management (e.g., intelligence activities) require different scenarios and different technical exercise environments in comparison to existing capabilities. The latter also includes the challenge of creating realistic federated mission networks for training purposes.</p><p>Key aspects in this entire chain are also the analysis of the performance of the cyber operators and the scoring of cyber security situational awareness.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence throughout the delivery of trainings and exercises (e.g., for Blue, Red, White and Green Teams) </strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>The use of AI in different phases and parts of cyber exercises and trainings has been researched and developed to an extent. This includes, for example, AI-based scenario generation, and AI-based Red/Blue Teams with hybrid skills (human + AI-based attack/defend strategies (developed in different private companies). AI also plays a pivotal role in generating comprehensive situational awareness for the development of realistic federated missions.</p><p>In the area of federated missions, which employ multiple teams operating from different locations, AI technologies could help to identify the operational deficiencies within each team member, informing subsequent training customisation and generating tailored scenarios.</p><p>It is clear that AI can assist in these and in other parts of cyber capability development. The proposals are expected to provide AI-based solutions that target all major parts of cyber exercise and training delivery, as well as AI-based solutions for the performance evaluation of the trainees using the hybrid skills.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises that leverage the concept of digital twins. </strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>Digital twins as a concept has a long history. The use of such solutions in cyber exercises has also been targeted previously but not with results that have been sufficiently persistent or useful. Therefore, the challenge remains on developing digital twins or other high-fidelity simulations that have a reasonable cost-effectiveness \u2013 given that a common dilemma in such simulations is finding a balance between cost of creating such digital copies and the learning impact that those simulations can offer on top of more standardised ways for IT/OT system and network simulations. One possible avenue for successful balancing of these requirements may be witnessed in the space domain, given its increased need for simulations and testing.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Develop or facilitate a framework for accreditation of training centres and personnel skill levels. </strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>The solutions should include a proposal on how to establish certified practices for accreditation of training centres (cyber ranges) and skill levels (personal and team certificates). The solution should take into account EU-wide accreditation schemes. However, these should allow for national specificities. Where possible, existing standards, such as relevant NATO practices, should be used.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>   <ol level=\"1\">    <li><strong>Cross-cutting items</strong></li>   </ol> </li> </ol><p>All solutions must address the <strong>challenge of sharing and pooling cyber range capabilities </strong>in a coordinated manner between cyber range providers. This challenge may be best addressed by using and enhancing existing initiatives and projects. Moreover, this sharing and pooling can be demonstrated, for example, via the implementation of the project\u2019s solutions in different cyber ranges through federation. If federation as an approach is used, it is expected that the proposals also cover the business and management side of the federation. This could, for example, formalise in the development of model cooperation agreements that mimic actual needs and have been developed with processes similar to actual processes (twin environments).</p><p>Where existing or new cyber range and cyber exercise standards (e.g., for scenario development and game net creation) are covered, the proposal must address the challenge of achieving a wide user-based of the standard. Proposing the use of any such standards without clearly addressing the way forward may invalidate the whole part of the proposal related to such standards because the success of a standard is as much dependent on the community as the standard\u2019s actual content.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome must contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Improving the armed forces autonomy, resilience, interoperability and capabilities in operations to support the growing needs of electrical energy for the weapons systems in the battlefield,</li><li>A decrease in the total costs of ownership of deployed capacities and supporting the growing needs of electrical energy for the weapons systems in the battlefield,</li><li>Enhancing the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the EU defence industry in the area of new energies,</li><li>Completing the global European strategy for renewable and sustainable energy, hence tackling the climate change,</li><li>Adapting to civilian sustainable energy technology, military requirements and develop European standards,</li><li>Improving the logistics processes and the ability to perform effective maintenance.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The future battlefield is likely to be dominated by weapon systems, platforms and devices that require electric energy. This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.</p><p>In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.</p><p>This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.</p><p>An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.</p><p>As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps. Furthermore, the ability to support the diminution of their fossil fuel consumptions while maintaining operational performances, avoiding logistics, security burden and reducing logistics footprint should be validated.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address a full-scale operational demonstrator of a deployable camp fulfilling interoperability between inter-allied armies and NATO, with a modular and easily deployable energy system and adaptable energy mix.</p><p>Proposals must pursue the feasibility study of different technologies to answer to the identified needs of the Member States and EDF Associated Countries while ensuring the interoperability of systems and taking into consideration opportunities such as autonomy or resilience. As innovative solutions evolve rapidly, the proposals should update results generated through the latest research in this domain. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness of logistics and maintenance in different scenarios (e.g., Host Nation Support, Contractor Support to Operations or by military themselves).</p><p>Proposals must design and produce the solutions (production, storage and management modules, including control and command interfaces, communication protocols, and operational simulation and planning systems). In order to ensure their safe use, functional tests must be performed before the demonstration stage.</p><p>Proposals must address physical experiment of the most critical technological modules deployed in military camps, especially the most vulnerable ones toward harsh environmental conditions and demanding operational scenarios, including resilience against electronic warfare, cyber-attacks and electromagnetic pulse.</p><p>Proposals must split the demonstration of the technological modules in different locations hosted by several Member States in different representative environment (cold/warm weather, dust, number of occupants, deployment duration, type of mission, etc.). In addition, the proposals must validate a wide range of operational use cases and assess the adaptability of the technology for the deployment in different scenarios.

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome must contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Improving the armed forces autonomy, resilience, interoperability and capabilities in operations to support the growing needs of electrical energy for the weapons systems in the battlefield,</li><li>A decrease in the total costs of ownership of deployed capacities and supporting the growing needs of electrical energy for the weapons systems in the battlefield,</li><li>Enhancing the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the EU defence industry in the area of new energies,</li><li>Completing the global European strategy for renewable and sustainable energy, hence tackling the climate change,</li><li>Adapting to civilian sustainable energy technology, military requirements and develop European standards,</li><li>Improving the logistics processes and the ability to perform effective maintenance.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The future battlefield is likely to be dominated by weapon systems, platforms and devices that require electric energy. This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.</p><p>In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.</p><p>This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.</p><p>An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.</p><p>As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps. Furthermore, the ability to support the diminution of their fossil fuel consumptions while maintaining operational performances, avoiding logistics, security burden and reducing logistics footprint should be validated.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address a full-scale operational demonstrator of a deployable camp fulfilling interoperability between inter-allied armies and NATO, with a modular and easily deployable energy system and adaptable energy mix.</p><p>Proposals must pursue the feasibility study of different technologies to answer to the identified needs of the Member States and EDF Associated Countries while ensuring the interoperability of systems and taking into consideration opportunities such as autonomy or resilience. As innovative solutions evolve rapidly, the proposals should update results generated through the latest research in this domain. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness of logistics and maintenance in different scenarios (e.g., Host Nation Support, Contractor Support to Operations or by military themselves).</p><p>Proposals must design and produce the solutions (production, storage and management modules, including control and command interfaces, communication protocols, and operational simulation and planning systems). In order to ensure their safe use, functional tests must be performed before the demonstration stage.</p><p>Proposals must address physical experiment of the most critical technological modules deployed in military camps, especially the most vulnerable ones toward harsh environmental conditions and demanding operational scenarios, including resilience against electronic warfare, cyber-attacks and electromagnetic pulse.</p><p>Proposals must split the demonstration of the technological modules in different locations hosted by several Member States in different representative environment (cold/warm weather, dust, number of occupants, deployment duration, type of mission, etc.). In addition, the proposals must validate a wide range of operational use cases and assess the adaptability of the technology for the deployment in different scenarios. Adding up, they should ensure testing, validation and qualification of the overall concept through simulation activities in real military context including in harsh conditions. Furthermore, the ability of the energy architectures and protocols endorsed to operate in civil-based (non-rugged) solutions should be demonstrated. The demonstration should cover the simulation and planning tools.</p><p>The focus must be on military use-cases, taking into account specific harsh military environment (cold/heat/dust), different deployments and conflict intensities (including the shift from low-intensity conflict to high-intensity warfare), different deployed infrastructures, different life-time phases of the camp (storage, building, operation and redeployment phase) and military heavy constraints (logistic, maintenance, training, risk management, unmanned).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Studies:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Study activities must build on ongoing, completed civil-based and military research and follow as well new solutions available on the market (hydrogen/synthetic fuels, non-fossil fuels from renewable sources, smart grid, microgrids, self-healing power systems, etc.) to validate the feasibility of deploying such solutions in operations areas.

This model must be validated in a relevant testing environment, using all the resources made available by supporting EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries.

integrated approach to conflicts \u201cat all stages of the conflict cycle, acting promptly on prevention, responding responsibly and decisively to crises, investing in stabilisation and avoiding premature disengagement when a new crisis erupts\u201d.</p><p>In order to support and, if necessary, enforce, the above approach, a credible deterrent is required to be rebuilt in terms of land combat capability with a priority focused on armoured vehicles in general and, in particular, on Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles (AIFV) remain a pivotal element of land military manoeuvre, both in a conventional warfare context as well as in the asymmetric one, thanks to the combination of protection, mobility, and firepower. Nonetheless, AIFVs currently numbered in the fleet inventories of the EU Member States are to some extent either ageing or obsolete and, therefore, the same States face the compelling need to modernise their in-service platforms and replace those of them approaching the end of their operational life. There is also a need to accelerate the acquisition and increase the size of the AIFV fleets updating some of the new requirements stemming from the war in Ukraine and the new threat scenarios. Against this background, the upgrade of the current and development of the next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios are highly necessary.</p><p>Modularity, reduced crew workload, the integration of automatic systems, Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T), and increased survivability must guide design considerations.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address studies and design for the upgrade of current armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the development of next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle technologies, with desirable outputs for legacy platforms, including enabling and green technologies (eco-design or sustainable technologies), leading to a system level capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios. Furthermore, they must take into account aspects such as mobility, deployability (tactical and strategic ones), autonomy, firepower, maintainability, survivability and cyber security.</p><p>Thematic scope of the activities to be supported is preliminary studies, system analysis and early development phases. It includes considerations of the system in operational perspective and identification of specific subsystems that define the future operational environment and purpose of system within the future battlefield.</p><p>Moreover, proposals should include development efforts of a new common European \u201cArmoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle\u201d (AIFV), and when feasible have a high commonality with solutions in other future European combat vehicles.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and

integrated approach to conflicts \u201cat all stages of the conflict cycle, acting promptly on prevention, responding responsibly and decisively to crises, investing in stabilisation and avoiding premature disengagement when a new crisis erupts\u201d.</p><p>In order to support and, if necessary, enforce, the above approach, a credible deterrent is required to be rebuilt in terms of land combat capability with a priority focused on armoured vehicles in general and, in particular, on Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicles (AIFV) remain a pivotal element of land military manoeuvre, both in a conventional warfare context as well as in the asymmetric one, thanks to the combination of protection, mobility, and firepower. Nonetheless, AIFVs currently numbered in the fleet inventories of the EU Member States are to some extent either ageing or obsolete and, therefore, the same States face the compelling need to modernise their in-service platforms and replace those of them approaching the end of their operational life. There is also a need to accelerate the acquisition and increase the size of the AIFV fleets updating some of the new requirements stemming from the war in Ukraine and the new threat scenarios. Against this background, the upgrade of the current and development of the next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios are highly necessary.</p><p>Modularity, reduced crew workload, the integration of automatic systems, Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T), and increased survivability must guide design considerations.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address studies and design for the upgrade of current armoured infantry fighting vehicles and the development of next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle technologies, with desirable outputs for legacy platforms, including enabling and green technologies (eco-design or sustainable technologies), leading to a system level capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios. Furthermore, they must take into account aspects such as mobility, deployability (tactical and strategic ones), autonomy, firepower, maintainability, survivability and cyber security.</p><p>Thematic scope of the activities to be supported is preliminary studies, system analysis and early development phases. It includes considerations of the system in operational perspective and identification of specific subsystems that define the future operational environment and purpose of system within the future battlefield.</p><p>Moreover, proposals should include development efforts of a new common European \u201cArmoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle\u201d (AIFV), and when feasible have a high commonality with solutions in other future European combat vehicles.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome is expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Bring a significant operational differentiator and contribute to enhanced interoperability between armed forces of Member States;</li><li>Develop and increase the maturity of innovative technologies specifically adapted to BLOS engagement;</li><li>Increase EU industry capabilities on BLOS architecture, components and technologies;</li><li>Consolidate European business consortium able to offer competitive solutions for the global market;</li><li>Decrease dependence on non-EU technologies and products.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The performance of land combat systems has proved decisive in recent conflicts, since the availability of mobile (tactical and strategical mobility) precision systems able to provide the necessary high degree of accuracy, efficiency and reactivity, are becoming increasingly important to avoid widespread collateral damage and reduce exposure of friendly forces. In particular, it is essential for Member States\u2019 armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.</p><p>To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.</p><p>In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the development of innovative technologies of interest to improve the performance of the capability;</li><li>the update of BLOS collaborative close combat architecture for the integration of new technologies / capabilities;</li><li>the development of effect management functions for BLOS capability;</li><li>the development or the integration of a BLOS battlefield training system for collaborative training indoor, outdoor and being able to use force on force;</li><li>the development of a common interface concept for dismounted system integration in light and medium vehicles and system compatibility with, but not limited to, ring mounted version;</li><li>the demonstration of a BLOS collaborative engagement that:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>should include firing from a dismounted version (possibly mounted on a light vehicle);</li><li>may include firing from a BLOS system integrated into a battlefield vehicle (deployed in a tactical situation).</li>   </ul>

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome is expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Bring a significant operational differentiator and contribute to enhanced interoperability between armed forces of Member States;</li><li>Develop and increase the maturity of innovative technologies specifically adapted to BLOS engagement;</li><li>Increase EU industry capabilities on BLOS architecture, components and technologies;</li><li>Consolidate European business consortium able to offer competitive solutions for the global market;</li><li>Decrease dependence on non-EU technologies and products.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The performance of land combat systems has proved decisive in recent conflicts, since the availability of mobile (tactical and strategical mobility) precision systems able to provide the necessary high degree of accuracy, efficiency and reactivity, are becoming increasingly important to avoid widespread collateral damage and reduce exposure of friendly forces. In particular, it is essential for Member States\u2019 armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.</p><p>To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.</p><p>In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the development of innovative technologies of interest to improve the performance of the capability;</li><li>the update of BLOS collaborative close combat architecture for the integration of new technologies / capabilities;</li><li>the development of effect management functions for BLOS capability;</li><li>the development or the integration of a BLOS battlefield training system for collaborative training indoor, outdoor and being able to use force on force;</li><li>the development of a common interface concept for dismounted system integration in light and medium vehicles and system compatibility with, but not limited to, ring mounted version;</li><li>the demonstration of a BLOS collaborative engagement that:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>should include firing from a dismounted version (possibly mounted on a light vehicle);</li><li>may include firing from a BLOS system integrated into a battlefield vehicle (deployed in a tactical situation).</li>   </ul>

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Develop critical enablers for Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) operations and develop concept of critical enablers for EU Battlegroup missions.</li><li>Enhance UxS self-defence and cooperative force protection.</li><li>Increase readiness and availability for equipment and personnel deployment of EU military missions.</li><li>Reduce the possible number of casualties on friendly forces.</li><li>Interoperability milestones for Member States\u2019 ground capacity programs.</li><li>Improve situational awareness, resilience and security of EU operations.</li><li>Create a reference for manned-unmanned teaming modes and functions to improve the capabilities of the European defence industry to develop and supply state-of-the-art ground systems.</li><li>Reinforce adaptation and interoperability of EU Member States\u2019 armed forces.</li><li>Strengthen the EU\u2019s strategic autonomy in military capabilities.</li><li>Optimise interoperability and synchronisation between manned and unmanned platforms, and soldier systems.</li><li>Reduce the impact of the logistic footprint.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The use of Unmanned x (generic) Vehicles (UxVs) in military operations represents one of the most important innovations of recent years. Undoubtedly, UxVs exploitation is likely to grow in the coming years with the massive introduction of other autonomous systems in different domains (land, air, sea, space, cyber) and the increase of capabilities to work collaboratively between systems (swarms) and people.</p><p>Indeed, intelligent and effective cooperation between military assets (UxVs, different types of vehicles and their operators, and dismounted soldiers) within Close Combat Operations is needed to increase the overall Battlespace effectiveness, while reducing loss of life, the risk of collateral damage and lowering the cognitive burden placed upon operators.</p><p>Therefore, deploying autonomous and swarm-based military assets in a framework of cooperation between manned and unmanned systems (manned-unmanned teaming) is a very important capability that can enable enhanced ISTAR, survivability, situation awareness, mobility, lethality, logistics and training, and increase the probability of battlefield combat success.</p><p>This would allow the rapid development of capacities implying an incremental approach of capabilities milestones for current and future land systems and upgrades of legacy systems.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The use of such UxV systems has a direct impact in reducing the exposure of human operators and soldiers to associated risks. Such systems can radically improve the efficiency and performance of the tactical unit to provide tactical/ operational superiority and offer robust and reliable solutions in very demanding conditions.</p><p>Thus, the aim of this topic is to develop an unmanned modular system of systems capable of supporting dismounted, mechanised and motorised infantry in all types of European geographic and operational land environments, including denied environments, in adverse light and weather conditions with evolving levels of autonomy and robustness.</p><p>The overarching goal of this topic is to contribute to the maturing, testing and verification of the Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) capability, so that the technology is expected to be ready for integration into the European armed forces by 2030. Therefore, to ensure wide acceptance and efficient use of the systems, it is pertinent to study, analyse and develop:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Detailed capability provision assessment for integration into force structures for supporting dismounted, mechanised, and motorised infantry.</li><li>Novel concepts for Human Machine Teaming to enable closed hatch and long-range usage of system capabilities with regards to ethical and legal aspects of combat operations. These concepts should allow a significantly reduced cognitive workload for UGS operator(s) by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the control, direction, monitoring, and supervision of unmanned systems through the development and application of artificial intelligence and assisted functions.</li><li>Enhanced manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned teaming capacities of UGSs through advancements in multirobot and swarming technology.</li><li>Modular design and open architectures (regarding platforms, autonomous functions, as well as effector, sensor and other payloads management) with standard interfaces to enable Through Life Capabilities Management (TLCM) in terms of interoperability, scalability, maintainability, availability, robustness and resilience. This should ensure transferability of technology with other manned and unmanned (including drive-by-wire legacy) platforms.</li><li>Federated digital-twin framework would favour this TCLM management and may provide improved training environment for UGS navigation and other mission specific algorithms.</li><li>State-of-the-art equipment and secure information availability to enable enhanced ISTAR, Survivability, Situational Awareness, Mobility, Lethality, Logistics and Training to ensure Battlefield Superiority.</li><li>Self-air-defence (against NATO Class I UAVs), in support of dismounted soldiers, with automatic designation by on-board electro-optical sensors and related data fusion.</li> </ul><p>Additional enablers for the wide acceptance and use of the Systems are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Formation of UGS related R&amp;D ecosystem/community that facilitates continuous innovation, synergies and inclusion of deep-tech start-ups, Technology and system testing, Evaluation, Verification and Validation (e.g., cross-border TEVV procedures, trust).</li><li>Practical testing in a scenario-based exercise (48+ h) with infantry units.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of a multipurpose Unmanned Ground System of systems with lethal effectors and solutions for systems integration and manned-unmanned teaming. This system must integrate the following abilities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance situational awareness and force protection of ground units, their combat effectiveness, endurance, mobility, and autonomy, and enable faster deployment.</li><li>Support dismounted, mechanised, and motorised infantry in all types of European geographic and operational land environments, including denied environments, in adverse light and weather conditions with evolving levels of autonomy and robustness.</li><li>Significantly reduce cognitive workload for UGS operator(s) using artificial intelligence and assisted functions.</li><li>Have a modular design and enhance interoperability with manned and unmanned platforms to ensure transferability of the relevant technology to other platforms (including existing manned vehicles) and simplify payload integration, with the aim of bringing together European industrial capabilities and define standard interfaces for the benefit of European defence.</li><li>Enhance manned-unmanned and unmanned-unmanned teaming capacities of current UGS.</li><li>Have the capability to analyse different weather conditions, terrain types and obstacles to increase the mobility of single UGS and UGS teams.</li> </ul><p>The proposal must also provide analysis on the following topics:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A fully autonomous targeting process and efficient effector(s) management and use against multiple types of targets, and include mobility solutions for engagement, target delegation and other relevant aspects of effector usage.</li><li>The ethical and legal aspects of integrating combat-UGS in the European armed forces (if needed, research to support recommendations/decisions on ethical and legal aspects related to integration of combat-UGS in the EU Armed Forces and their interaction with human beings in the land domain should be included).</li> </ul><p>Proposals should also integrate the development and TLCM support of equipment (hardware or software) designed to enable personnel to function within different manned-unmanned operational modes and environments, able to be deployed in the digitised Battlefield where all land system assets are available to operate in coherence and demonstrating the following abilities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>To interconnect in real time within the Battlefield and in a fully secured way with an extended set of systems supported by an intelligent TLCM solution concept.</li><li>To be integrated seamlessly in the digitised systems (e.g., power supply, situational awareness, targeting process) manned or unmanned as and when needed during combat missions.</li><li>To adopt real-time cooperative functionality and enhance Battlefield combat superiority, adaptation and effectiveness with measurable impacts of actions.</li><li>To cooperate within the Battlefield while being able to sustain connectivity and interact with other assets (dismounted troops, UxVs, manned vehicles, swarms, long range support).</li><li>To enable a versatile use in order to be deployed for a large spectrum of close combat operations and provide superior and optimised operational

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the commonality of European naval systems to increase interoperability and interchangeability among European defence naval industries and Navies;</li><li>an integrated survivability of naval vessels, more resilient against future threats, and with a reduced size and safer crew;</li><li>promoting the EU strategic autonomy in the naval sector, configuring naval forces that respond to national and European strategic needs and trends;</li><li>reducing the development and maintenance cost of future systems throughout their life-cycle;</li><li>developing innovative systems, more efficient, scalable, and adaptable to different naval platforms.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Evolving operational environment and threats require the development of cutting-edge maritime technologies, solutions, and systems, which should be able to operate interconnected in a fully integrated way under challenging multi-domain (i.e., land, aerial, surface, subsurface, and cyber) threat conditions.</p><p>Naval platforms trends are based on technologies, standards, solutions, and systems, all designed from the start to work integrated together in a coherent manner, ensuring the survivability of the platform against emerging threats. Therefore, the main objective of this topic is to identify, define, design, and develop them, to be integrated on future European naval platforms.</p><p>The topic should act as a real enabler for both the European naval industry and the EU Navies. In that context, it should be very inclusive to be adapted to the most European Navies\u2019 needs for their future naval platforms. It will allow EU Navies to remain at the forefront of technology, to maximise interoperability and the survivability by design, to operate with technological superiority, and to increase EU strategic autonomy. At industrial level, this topic should be an instrument for the European industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to define the common operational requirements of the System of Systems (SoS) framework and the essential elements of the next generation of European naval platforms. Such a SoS framework is expected to embrace the supporting infrastructure including interfaces, data, and common and specific services. It must identify the technological needs for the future development of European naval platforms with special attention on emerging technologies, promising solutions, and the increased resilience of naval vessels when facing the most sophisticated threats by near real-time evaluation of survivability.</p><p>In particular, the topic should contribute to solve these specific challenges:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The capability to operate interconnected in a fully integrated way, under challenging multi-domain (i.e., land, aerial, surface, subsurface and cyber) threat conditions.</li><li>The definition and the design of the core architecture of the future European naval platforms by a SoS approach.</li><li>The analysis of naval vessels survivability aspects on an operational level, considering its three key aspects (i.e., susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability) under an integral approach, leading to a resilient ship.</li> </ul><p>This topic aims to identify and define essential elements for future European naval platforms as functional system building blocks by specifying a full set of new technologies, solutions, and systems to be fitted on board, covering the following main areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Four pillars:</li><li><strong>Combat System.</strong> New threats based on emerging technologies lead to the development of combat systems with enhanced sensors collaborating under an extended top-side concept that increase the detection capability, in time and accuracy, as well as new weapons/effectors able to face them, based on decision making algorithms to allow shorter reaction time to engage those threats. The UxVs are to be integrated into the Combat System as an extension of the detection and defence capability. In terms of survivability, specific challenges to susceptibility are the required countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, together with the ability to predict and manage where a missile or a torpedo might impact the vessel, as an important interface between susceptibility and vulnerability. UxVs should be also analysed in relation to ship survivability.</li><li><strong>Communication and Information System. </strong>Solutions need to be sought to meet emerging challenges in this area such as the management of a big volume of data transmitted at high speed (comparable to 5G and ahead) in a very demanding operational theatre, the integrity and cybersecurity of the data, and the EU naval tactical cloud integrated in a military multidomain operations cloud. Special consideration should be made on anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) scenarios, defining embarked cloud capabilities to support the edge operation of joint forces overseas. Attention must also be paid to complete loss of connectivity due to denial or due to stealth reasons.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Platform Management System</strong>. New threats and evolving technologies should lead to redefine the current concept of naval platforms to ensure enough and adequate power generation, as well as a proper top-side compatible with new weapons and UxV launch and recovery systems (LARS) on board. In the same way, future naval platforms should address efficient platform control and management, as well as increased power supply needs for future weapons and sensors, and new energy technologies to achieve the European Green Deal objectives. In addition, ship signature management, smart damage control, and survivability aspects should be considered because countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, or the impact of hypersonic missile or torpedo affect the vulnerability of the platform (e.g., a successful hard-kill engagement might result in debris hitting the ship, the success soft-kill deployments strongly affect the ship signatures). The impact of such events should be studied, and technical solutions to withstand the physical and system damage should be identified.</li><li><strong>Navigation System.</strong> Solutions should be sought for increased safety during navigation, independent satellite positioning system, accurate inertial navigation system, autonomous operations and multi-manned and unmanned, underwater, surface, and aerial vehicles coordinated navigation.</li><li>One transversal area linked to the four pillars:</li><li><strong>Survivability Advisory System Foundation</strong>. The evolving threat landscape should result in a need for an advisory capability to assist in the setting of the ship signature management system, the deployment of hard-kill and soft-kill countermeasures, the adjustment of the ship\u2019s signature for hit-point management, the post-hit damage assessment, the remaining capability including strength and systems, and the deployment of recovery actions to regain functionality. This should also allow for future task group advisory capabilities, where high value assets should be protected by the task group, and the survivability of the task group is expected to be optimised due to advice across the task group.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should design a SoS framework: Solutions should be sought based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution, that might sustain the above-mentioned areas. It should include transversal capabilities like for instance, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Based Decision Making, Digital Twin, Federated Mission Networking, Through-Life Support based on virtual reality and remote systems monitoring, Cyberwarfare, or Survivability</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The definition of common operational requirements of the essential elements for the future European naval platforms, covering the main areas (i.e., Combat System, Communication and Information System, Enhanced Platform Management System and Navigation System) under an integral survivability approach (i.e., Survivability Advisory System Foundation);</li><li>The development of a concept of a SoS framework, typically based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution that might sustain the concerned areas;</li><li>The definition of a modular, interoperable, scalable, and flexible concept design to support an architecture that should provide a versatile solution for answering future Navies\u00b4 needs and trends;</li><li>The identification of emerging technologies that should respond to the operational needs of the future naval platforms, including integrated operational data-, messaging-, telecom-communication systems;</li><li>The design of a tool for the management of the ship signature while advising on the status and solutions for timely and accurate deployment of countermeasures, both active (e.g., advanced jammers, signature manipulators) and passive (e.g., flares, chaff, corner cubes), coordinated with hard-kill solutions, and including the prediction and management of the hit-point;</li><li>The assessment of existing solutions and the consideration of new damage control systems where appropriate through automated systems, crew actions, and recovery of systems, while performing predictions of the state of the ship after incidents, likely based on AI that processes sensor readings/information and imaging;</li><li>The design of an operational guidance system to support the Navigation System for ship operations with a damaged and undamaged ship (e.g., advice for helicopter operations, UxV deployment);</li><li>The identification of the priorities on technologies to be further develop in the future, as well as the level of maturity to be achieved for the associated elements;</li><li>The analysis of a tool for the European naval industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies;</li><li>The operational assessment and the analysis of the technical viability, as well as the evaluation of the feasibility of the baseline concepts;</li><li>The design of a joint technology demonstrator and to de-risk potential further activities in the future.</li> </ul><p>In addition, the proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with activities

extensive Prolonged Field Care (PFC) training due to a wide variety of factors. Studies to evaluate hospital preparedness have shown that good response plans can be developed for complex medical training scenarios (such as radiation exposure response), and that medical providers can be trained to follow these plans if the given training is realistic in its delivery.</p><p>Effective military medical training and readiness for PFC require decision training, performance of individual medical procedures and excellent teamwork skills in austere conditions of fast changing battlefield conditions of large-scale symmetrical conflict or natural disaster. Military medical training based on both computer-generated, hybrid and physical teaching materials creates advantage to development of cost-effective training courses for the military and civilian medical (support) personnel population and paramedics.</p><p>European Union has already started its efforts for developing military medics\u2019 innovative training solutions, focused on Field Care and Role 1 scenarios. In order to take full advantage of military medics training simulation, additional operational scenarios and functionalities in a virtual reality environment have to be developed and integrated into a network of federated toolbox which provides interconnection and joint access to simulation systems that are supporting different but mutually complementing simulation methods like mixed, augmented, hybrid, part task trainers, logistics, manikins and medical equipment, but currently are unevenly distributed in the European market for the medical personnel and paramedic training.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The topic aims to address the current operational challenges facing military medical personnel in the EU Member States (MS) and EDF Associated Countries, including in and out of areas of deployment.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of a prototyped solution for a federation of available and enhanced medical simulation systems that support military medical curriculum and are connected to a (at best AI-based) feedback system (that may include real medical and health-data as benchmarking) that enables to see integrated picture of all training related information.</p><p>Proposals must therefore address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Medical Training Modules</strong>: The Medical Training Modules are designed to impart knowledge in military medicine to trainees. At present, the guidelines are anchored in Tactical Combat Casualty Care, serving as vital training curricula for both medical and non-medical personnel in civilian and military contexts. Looking ahead to future battlefield situations, insights from Ukraine underscore the importance of updating existing guidelines with a Prolonged Casualty Care environments. This adaptation is essential in preparing Europeans to confront diverse battlefield scenarios. Training modules can provide realistic, scenario-based learning experiences covering trauma, infections, and radiation exposure. They extend across various environments, including battlefield tranches, vehicles, and aircraft, offering comprehensive multi-modal and interdisciplinary training. The integration of virtual and mixed technologies elevates the delivery of educational content and learning retention. The overarching focus is effective communication, coordination, and preparedness for non-medical professionals in dynamic settings of the battlefield.</li><li><strong>Supporting elements enabling Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network</strong>: The Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network employs advanced technologies to create a comprehensive and realistic training environment. This includes cloud-based solutions for simultaneous management of large casualties, integration of digital computer simulated casualties for dynamic scenarios, physical simulated patients for hands-on training, and physical manikin systems replicating human responses. Crucially, seamless data exchange between computer-generated simulations and physical systems ensures a cohesive training experience. The interconnected federated network allows collaborative exercises across different locations, with real-time monitoring and feedback enhancing the learning process. Scalability, customisation, and integration of virtual, mixed, and augmented reality technologies contribute to an immersive and adaptable training platform for military non-medical and medical professionals.</li><li><strong>Integration with Real World</strong>: The integration of 5G technology into medical education signifies a transformative approach for European Union medical training centres. This integration facilitates the delivery of educational content with high-speed, low-latency connectivity, enabling real-time and immersive learning experiences. Learning analytics tools add a data-driven dimension, offering insights into individual and collective learning patterns. Augmented reality serves as a powerful teaching aid, particularly for Definitive Surgical Trauma Care, enhancing trainees' understanding through virtual overlays in the real-world environment. This comprehensive integration fosters scalable and distributed training solutions, promotes remote collaboration, and ensures standardisation and quality assurance across diverse training centres.

development of a European solution.</li><li>The availability of a critical enabler for CSDP operations and missions in providing scalable secure and resilient communications in peacetime and during

increase European autonomy in satellite communication for defence users and remove dependency on support from outside the EU for the transmission and exchange of mission critical and sensitive information;</li><li>State-of-the-art technological solution in line with the latest satellite innovations and initiatives such as 5G, small LEO/MEO satellites, connected vehicles and Internet of things.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>In today\u2019s military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today\u2019s military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.</p><p>Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.</p><p>The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:</p><p><u>1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States </u></p><p>The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><p><u>2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services </u></p><p>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><p><u>3/ Flexibility and scalability </u></p><p>The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.</p><p><u>4/ Innovation </u></p><p>The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><p><u>5/ Security and resilience </u></p><p>The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>The availability of a critical enabler for CSDP operations and missions in providing scalable secure and resilient communications in peacetime and during operations with protection against intrusion, hacking, jamming, traffic monitoring and eavesdropping;</li><li>Full interoperability between different demanders and suppliers of satellite communication in support of military operations and missions;</li><li>Secure, guaranteed and affordable access to satellite communications for all Member States and EDF Associated Countries;</li><li>Strongly increase European autonomy in satellite communication for defence users and remove dependency on support from outside the EU for the transmission and exchange of mission critical and sensitive information;</li><li>State-of-the-art technological solution in line with the latest satellite innovations and initiatives such as 5G, small LEO/MEO satellites, connected vehicles and Internet of things.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>In today\u2019s military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today\u2019s military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.</p><p>Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.</p><p>The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:</p><p><u>1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States </u></p><p>The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><p><u>2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services </u></p><p>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><p><u>3/ Flexibility and scalability </u></p><p>The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.</p><p><u>4/ Innovation </u></p><p>The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><p><u>5/ Security and resilience </u></p><p>The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and

As such, an overall approach needs to be envisaged to align the EPW development with the complementary security and resiliency technologies for ground and space segments, leading to the following additional requirements:</p><p>The EPW should be integrated into a larger multi-layered security &amp; resilience architecture that:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Contains anti-jamming technologies that allow to detect, mitigate, prevent and predict jamming efforts by 3rd party adversaries. This could be tackled through spectrum monitoring, geolocation and network management technologies working together with nulling or interference excision technologies as well as Anti-Jam waveform capabilities as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum, Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum and beam forming technologies;</li><li>Allows for network diversity, redundancy and geo-redundancy technologies to increase the resilience of the satellite network as well as for multi-access capabilities (hybrid LTE/5G/etc.) with intelligent routing;</li><li>Can dynamically steer its radiation pattern accordingly to connect to another satellite in a different frequency and satellite orbit to increase network resiliency. Fixed, on-the-move and on-the-pause land-based and maritime terminals, man packs and antenna systems, including airborne terminals and antenna systems installed on rotatory wings (RW), need to be considered as well as different types of antenna technologies (e.g., parabolic, electronically steered, phased array, flat antennas, etc.).

The flexibility and the affordability of the terminal are key considerations.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A Software Defined Mode type of baseband equipment should be pursued;</li><li>The baseband infrastructure (hubs and modems) should cover multiple architecture types of networks (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, mesh) and satellite (wideband, spot beam, mix of both, transparent, processed) architectures;</li><li>The EPW should operate on Software Defined hardware from different vendors to be selected by nations, government and defence agencies or institutions, depending on their preference or acquisition processes;</li><li>The EPW should include the ability to receive and transmit various modulation methods using a common set of hardware;</li><li>The EPW should be future-proof, easy to upgrade and change configurations (over-the-air) and offer the ability to alter functionality by downloading and running new software at will, in order to repurpose the modem for new applications;</li><li>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, save resources for planning) and CAPEX (save on equipment cost) compared to existing expensive military satellite modems;</li><li>The EPW should consider Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) constraints for on-the-pause and on-the-move platforms and unmanned systems. Modems and terminals should be easy to transport and deployed and use a minimum amount of power;</li><li>The EPW should be deployable in different environment conditions and on different platforms (land, sea or air);</li><li>The EPW should be available in different form factors (OEM cards, rack units or rugged terminals);</li><li>The EPW should be transparent for national encryption standards and externally encrypted data, and capable of integrating on-board modules for encryption technology.</li> </ul><p><u>On-board Transponder requirements:</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The EPW should consider different transponder technologies including next generation ones (i.e., fully transparent transponder; processed transparent transponder; new generation processed interactive transponder).</li><li>The EPW processed transponder should contribute to improve link performance; adoption of (individual) gain adjustment mechanism for dynamic power level control needs to be considered.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder should be able to support operation in GNSS-denied environments by implementing enhanced mechanisms dedicated to the network elements synchronisation and aided fast signal acquisition.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder should improve the Low Probability of Detection (LPD) and Low Probability of Interception (LPI) factors.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder must provide protection against intrusion and jamming.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder must deny connectivity for unauthorised transmission attempts by guaranteeing exclusive access to the satellite resource.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder should be able to implement enhanced mechanism, addressed in the EPW project, devoted to decoupling the transmission schemes between downlink and uplink signals in order to de-correlate uplink and downlink signals activity and prevent eavesdropping and activity monitoring for ongoing operations and assets.</li><li>The EPW interactive transponder architecture should be designed maximising the employment of Software Defined solutions in order to perform future upgrade/changes of configuration.</li> </ul>"], "identifier": ["EDF-2024-DA-SPACE-EPW-STEP"], "es_ContentType": ["text/plain"], "programmePeriod": ["2021 - 2027"], "deadlineDate": ["2024-11-05T00:00:00.000+0100"], "es_Combine": ["1"], "esST_URL": ["https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/data/topicDetails/EDF-2024-DA-SPACE-EPW-STEP.json"], "tags": ["STEP-Digital/deep tech"], "esDA_QueueDate": ["2024-09-10T11:50:38.067+0200"], "mission": [], "destinationDescription": [], "actions": ["[{\"types\":[{\"typeOfAction\":\"EDF-DA EDF Development Actions\",\"typeOfMGA\":[{\"id\":44175699,\"abbreviation\":\"EDF-AG\",\"description\":\"EDF Action Grant Budget-Based\"}]}],\"status\":{\"id\":31094502,\"abbreviation\":\"Open\",\"description\":\"Open\"},\"plannedOpeningDate\":\"2024-06-20\",\"submissionProcedure\":{\"id\":31094504,\"abbreviation\":\"single-stage\",\"description\":\"single-stage\"},\"deadlineDates\":[\"2024-11-05\"]}]"], "startDate": ["2024-06-20T00:00:00.000+0200"], "deadlineModel": ["single-stage"], "status": ["31094502"], "supportInfo": ["<p>For help related to this&nbsp;<b>call</b>, please contact:&nbsp;<font color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><a href=\"http://DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu\" target=\"_blank\">DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu</a></font></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/faq;grantAndTendertype=1;categories=p_submission_eval;programme=null;actions=;keyword=;period=null\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal FAQ</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Submission of proposals.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/helpdesks/contact-form\">IT Helpdesk</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Contact the IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\">Online Manual</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Step-by-step online guide through the Portal processes from proposal preparation and submission to reporting on your on-going project.

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strategic autonomy of EDTIB in the area of minesweeping systems.   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Fostering the technological cooperation of industries in the field of uncrewed sweeping drones and signature sources.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Interoperability of EU Member States Armed Forces:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>System definition and proof of concepts for a future European minesweeping system.</li><li>Common requirements and harmonisation of minesweeping concepts.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Uncrewed systems are a familiar asset in naval capabilities, and they are being increasingly adopted. These types of assets and the technologies that go with them have the potential to offer a diverse mission set, minesweeping being one of them. The maritime drones and their payloads currently used and integrated by the navies operate with different levels of autonomy and endurance. This topic aims to enhance naval minesweeping capabilities by pushing the design and level of the autonomy of particularly maritime drones. Furthermore, this topic addresses sweep gear and sweep sources for minesweeping operations adjoining the higher level of autonomy. In this context the drone/platform and its payload/sweeping gear form the minesweeping system.</p><p>Minesweeping is traditionally performed using mechanical or influence sweep sources towed behind a highly specialised and expensive crewed platform (minesweeper). Evolving technologies, such as autonomous features, offer new solutions to the minesweeping systems. These solutions in concert with new operational concepts offer European navies the opportunity to maximise the benefits of common development. Typically, a distinction can be made between drones with towed signature sources and those with integrated sources installed aboard.</p><p>The size and capability of a minesweeping drone and its payload are defined by the operational needs. These needs vary in environmental aspects from inshore operations with short transit and limited operation times in sheltered areas to operations in unsheltered areas potentially exposed to heavy wind and large waves with long standoff distances. The variation in operational needs with respect to the subject of protection can be from smaller merchant vessels and military vessels with reduced underwater signatures to large civilian merchants with significant underwater signatures.</p><p>The underwater signature and the shock resistance of the minesweeping system is a crucial part of its design and a fundamental feature of minesweeping operations.</p><p>The objective of this call is to reach at least technology readiness level 6 for a minesweeping system (platform/drone and payload designed for it).</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must target minesweeping systems (platform/drone and payload/sweeping gear) with autonomous features that are capable of performing influence sweeping in open-sea conditions against mines that target large merchant vessels (such as Landing Platform Dock (LPD), Ro-Ro vessels etc. up to around 200m length). The proposals must investigate and develop capable and cost-effective drone systems for influence minesweeping. This includes the interfaces to enabling systems such as launch and recovery (LARS) of the sweep system and command and control (C2) systems (including planning and evaluation tools).</p><p>The proposals may include solutions that include modified mechanical minesweeping operations.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposals must address reducing time (improved effectiveness) and risk for personnel and materiel in minesweeping operations. Development of uncrewed systems and autonomous features are seen as enablers in this regard. Improvements must address at least vehicle design regarding underwater signatures, propulsion system, and shock resistance to benefit both operational quality and efficiency. Improvements should also address features such as low maintenance effort, survivability, endurance, and modularity.</p><p>The proposals should address multi-purpose functions with the aim of supporting additional Naval Warfare operations, such as, but not limited to, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Maritime Evacuation Operations. This may imply that features, such as, but not limited to, LARS, interaction with several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), operation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments, towing of sonar systems, and use of mine disposal systems are incorporated.</p><p>The outcome should benefit a European interoperable and interchangeable NMCM Future Sweeping System designed with incremental capabilities to counter current and new mine threats consisting of enhanced intelligent platforms. Furthermore, the outcome should address the development of influence sweep source demonstrators for relevant underwater signatures (such as acoustic, magnetic, pressure and electric).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Studies:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Research and studies on relevant signature levels, characteristic and frequencies as well as sweep tactics.</li><li>Defining the sweep signatures in the acoustic, magnetic, pressure and electric field.

contributes to the Union strategic autonomy and its freedom of action.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>To fulfil their missions, the next generation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are expected to offer an increased level of autonomy. Their effective deployment necessitates key features of swarming and navigation to target positions when GNSS availability is contested or lost and more generally in non-permissive environments. The use of various types of sensors (e.g. inertial, optical, infrared, hyperspectral, radar, LIDAR, acoustic, etc.) and intelligent information fusion are needed to provide the necessary capabilities to tackle these technical and operational challenges. Such intelligent navigation payloads should be usable on a wide range of unmanned assets, including in swarm formations, while having a low SWaP-C (Size, Weight, Power and Costs). Their performances should be measured in a quantitative, objective and comparable way.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address technological solutions for autonomous aerial drone navigation in non-permissive environments.

"descriptionByte": ["<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and new partnerships that drive collective progress in AI solution development for defence imagery analysis at the EU level;</li><li>The development of policies and potential standards for AI in defence imagery analysis, enhancing interoperability across EU Member States;</li><li>An enhanced cost-effectiveness of systems, optimising resource utilisation and reducing operational expenses.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The objective evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as those used for satellite image analysis, requires a specific organisation whereby systems are tested on datasets that are new to the systems (blind testing), but that are representative of the tasks under study, and using common protocols. This scheme is commonly referred to as a \u201ctechnological challenge\u201d. One objective of the call is to organise a technological challenge driving research toward enhanced satellite image analysis for defence applications, and in particular for the combined analysis of optical and radar images. While a few challenges on satellite image analysis are organised in other contexts, there is a need for evaluations focusing on defence use cases, and for large datasets with annotations enabling accurate performance measurements.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address the organisation of a technological challenge on multi-source satellite image analysis based on the preliminary evaluation plan provided as part of the call document (see Annex 4b). This includes the collection, annotation and distribution of data, and the writing of the evaluation plans. The proposals must also address the possibility to involve representative defence users testing the demonstrators produced by the participating teams and providing feedback.</p><p>The following use cases should be considered when elaborating the evaluation plans:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Target analysis: vehicle functional status recognition, target identification and early target detection, classification and recognition.</li><li>Monitoring and tracking: change in detection, camps, oil tank volume estimation, non-linear tracking of targets, routes.</li><li>Searching: disturbed terrain detection, vehicle trails or moving targets detection, camouflage and material detection, minefield detection.</li><li>Mapping: terrain modelling (ground, water, roads, constructions), trafficability analysis and obstacle detection, coastal bathymetry for shallow waters.</li><li>Damage assessment: battle damage assessment, detection of climate/environment disaster-affected areas impacting defence operations.</li> </ul><p>Both optical and radar images must be considered. They may include the following:</p><p><u>Optical</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Standard (i.e., in the visible part of the EM spectrum) panchromatic and/or multispectral images with various spatial resolutions below or above 1 metre depending on the selected use-cases, based on commercial, dual-use or defence systems.</li><li>Hyperspectral images with various spatial resolutions below 50m, based on scientific, commercial, dual-use or defence systems.</li><li>Infrared images.</li> </ul><p>This may include multi-view stereo or video modes where available.</p><p><u>Radar</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>X-band SAR images (amplitude and phase, different polarisation) with various resolutions below or above 1 metre depending on the selected use-cases, based on commercial, dual-use or defence systems.</li><li>C or S-band SAR images.</li><li>P or L-band SAR images.</li> </ul><p>The use of optical and radar aerial imagery may also be considered, in particular to test systems on high-resolution images for certain types of images (e.g. hyperspectral or infrared, simulation of higher resolution images).</p><p>Metadata that would normally be used in operational scenarios should be provided.</p><p>The actual types of images and metadata to be used for the challenge should be described in the proposals.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following

technological modules submitted to the tests by the participating teams according to the protocols and metrics described in the evaluation plans;</li><li>Organisation of the debriefing workshops</li>     </ul> </li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The proposals should include clear descriptions of the proposed criteria to assess work package completion. Criteria should include the production of detailed evaluation plans agreed upon by all stakeholders, the production of the annotated databases needed for the evaluations, the production of measurements for all systems submitted to the tests by the participating teams following these plans, and the organisation of the needed events.</p><p><em><strong>Functional requirements</strong></em></p><p>The proposed solutions should enable the measurement of the performances of satellite image analysis systems according to detailed evaluation plans based on the preliminary evaluation plan provided as part of this call document (see Annex 4b). Key aspects of the foreseen detailed evaluation plans and associated data management should be described in the proposals.</p><p>Proposals should in particular describe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the detailed use cases to be addressed and the nature and size of image data to collect;</li><li>the nature and volume of data annotation to be produced, the order of magnitude of the number of different semantic classes, object types and characteristics considered for annotations, and the granularity of these classes with examples;</li><li>a framework for trusted sharing of data during the challenge and beyond;</li><li>a detailed plan of the test campaigns and an overall timeline/Gantt chart of the challenge;</li><li>the evaluation procedures (rules and tools to implement the metrics) and significance tests to be performed on measurements.</li> </ul><p>A user board consisting of representative defence users should be set up and involved in the preparation of the evaluation plans and of the data. Data should be representative of use cases of interest for defence. Proposals should describe the foreseen efforts from users to test demonstrators and provide feedback.</p><p>Data may be annotated in a semi-automatic way. Agreements may be sought with participants to use automatic tools developed by them. All annotations should be manually checked. To assess the relevance and accuracy of the data annotations, at least part of the data should be annotated by two independent annotators. The two sets of annotations should be compared to each other using the same metrics as for the evaluation of system outputs. An analysis of this inter-annotator agreement should be presented during the evaluation campaign workshops.</p><p>During the challenge, a detailed evaluation plan should be prepared for each evaluation campaign. Drafts of these detailed evaluation plans should be submitted for discussion to the participating teams, early enough to take into account feedback and leave time for system development before the actual test campaigns. Any evolution of the evaluation plans should take into account several factors: technical possibilities and cost, scientific relevance of the measurement, and representativeness of the metrics and protocols with respect to military needs. The justification of any change that is not subject to a consensus should be documented.</p><p>The user board and the participating teams should be involved in the steering of the challenge. Proposals should include a clear description of the foreseen governance and decision-making processes.</p>"], "identifier": ["EDF-2024-LS-RA-CHALLENGE-SPACE-MSIAO"], "es_ContentType": ["text/plain"], "programmePeriod": ["2021 - 2027"], "deadlineDate": ["2024-11-05T00:00:00.000+0100"], "es_Combine": ["1"], "esST_URL": ["https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/data/topicDetails/EDF-2024-LS-RA-CHALLENGE-SPACE-MSIAO.json"], "tags": [], "esDA_QueueDate": ["2024-09-10T11:56:26.978+0200"], "mission": [], "destinationDescription": [], "actions": ["[{\"types\":[{\"typeOfAction\":\"EDF-LS EDF Lump Sum Grants\",\"typeOfMGA\":[{\"id\":45095551,\"abbreviation\":\"EDF-AG-LS\",\"description\":\"EDF Lump Sum Grant\"}]}],\"status\":{\"id\":31094502,\"abbreviation\":\"Open\",\"description\":\"Open\"},\"plannedOpeningDate\":\"2024-06-20\",\"submissionProcedure\":{\"id\":31094504,\"abbreviation\":\"single-stage\",\"description\":\"single-stage\"},\"deadlineDates\":[\"2024-11-05\"]}]"], "startDate": ["2024-06-20T00:00:00.000+0200"], "deadlineModel": ["single-stage"], "status": ["31094502"], "supportInfo": ["<p>For help related to this&nbsp;<b>call</b>, please contact:&nbsp;<font color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><a href=\"http://DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu\" target=\"_blank\">DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu</a></font></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/faq;grantAndTendertype=1;categories=p_submission_eval;programme=null;actions=;keyword=;period=null\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal FAQ</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Submission of proposals.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/helpdesks/contact-form\">IT Helpdesk</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Contact the IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\">Online Manual</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Step-by-step online guide through the Portal processes from proposal preparation and submission to reporting on your on-going project.

"descriptionByte": ["<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>an enhanced exploitation of satellite images, by automating the workflow of imagery intelligence production and enabling analysts to focus on value-added tasks;</li><li>the EU technological edge and autonomy for defence-related satellite imagery analysis.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Imagery analysis and in particular satellite image analysis is an important component of defence intelligence. It enables to gather strategic and operational information on facilities, vehicles and forces on the ground and on the seas with a good geographic coverage across the Earth, and to assess the status of suspicious or hostile activities.</p><p>Satellite imagery analysis has long relied on traditional techniques, but the ever-increasing amounts of available satellite images has led to a need for automated analysis technologies. These technologies have been the subject of much research over several decades, and the steady progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular of AI-based image recognition has led to new tools appearing on the market. However, much of the development work and technological challenges in this field have focused on image types other than satellite images, and there is a need to foster the progress of satellite image analysis technologies. In this context, the general objective of this call topic is to enhance these technologies by giving research teams the opportunity to benefit from the organisation of a technological challenge dedicated to them.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective </em></strong></p><p>Optical and radar images of a given geographic area contain complementary information. While these different types of images result from very different physical principles, which make their combination quite challenging, such a combination can lead to improved information extraction and capabilities. This call topic therefore aims at progressing information fusion approaches towards this objective.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address technological solutions to detect, identify and characterise relevant information from multi-source satellite images, in particular by taking advantage of the complementarity of optical and radar images. These technological solutions must be evaluated in the framework of the technological challenge organised under this call. Technologies should be integrated into demonstrators that can be tested by representative defence users on their own data.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Generating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Research on satellite image analysis technologies.</li><li>Participation to the evaluation campaigns organised in the framework of the technological challenge, including:     <ul level=\"2\"><li>exchanges with other stakeholders on the evaluation plans;</li><li>participation to the test campaigns whereby the performances of the technological modules are measured on the test data provided by the challenge organisers;</li><li>participation to debriefing workshops.</li>     </ul> </li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>In addition, the proposals should cover the following tasks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Integrating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Integration of technological modules into demonstrators that can be tested by representative defence users.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities with foreseen, ongoing or completed activities in the field of satellite imagery analysis, notably those that may be performed in the context of the EDIDP (e.g. under the call topic EDIDP-ISR-PEO-2019), the EDF (e.g. under the call topics EDF-2021-DIGIT-R-FL on <em>Frugal learning for rapid adaptation of AI systems</em>, EDF-2022-RA-DIGIT-DBIR on <em>Shared databases and integrated systems for image recognition</em>, EDF-2022-DA-SPACE-ISR on <em>Innovative multi-sensor space-based Earth observation capabilities towards persistent and reactive ISR</em>, or EDF-2024-RA-DIGIT-ASMEP on <em>Automated Structural Modelling for Effect Prediction</em>), the EU Space programme (e.g. feasibility studies on potential EU Earth-observation services for governmental use), Horizon Europe or within the European Defence Agency (EDA) (e.g. the Capability Technology Group on Space activities).</p><p>The proposals should include clear descriptions of the proposed criteria to assess work package completion.

the area of defence.</li><li>Enhanced innovation capacity of the European defence industry by identifying and exploring ground-breaking concepts and approaches or by applying technologies and concepts previously not applied in the defence sector.</li><li>Enhanced competitiveness of the European defence industry and creation of new defence markets.</li><li>Enhanced defence research and innovation capacity across Europe by involvement of actors that can make a difference in the future such as excellent researchers, ambitious high-tech SMEs or visionary departments of big companies, universities

["<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution;</li><li>an enhanced operational superiority in terms of PNT and sensing, and secure communications in the long term at optimal cost;</li><li>an enhanced EU technological autonomy for quantum technologies for defence.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Quantum technologies count amongst the main emerging and disruptive technologies for defence capabilities. Within these quantum technologies, Quantum Sensing (QS) is one of the most mature domains and has the potential to notably impact defence operations. Nevertheless, significant technical challenges remain before operational systems can be developed. Further research is therefore needed in a range of QS domains such as quantum sensors for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), optronics and RF sensing. Besides, with the possible emergence of quantum computers, current technologies for secure communications face a risk of becoming compromised and need to be upgraded. There is therefore a need for research on technologies future-proof communication technologies such as quantum communication or quantum-resistant cryptography.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address at least one of the following technological domains:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\" level=\"0\">  <li><u>Quantum sensing technologies for PNT</u></li> </ol><p>The proposals should address quantum sensing technologies with the potential to improve PNT capabilities, such as high performances atomic clocks, quantum inertial sensors and gravimeters, and solid-state quantum vector magnetometers. Specific enabling technologies for improving size, weight and power (SWaP), to increase efficiency and/or ruggedness while lowering the overall footprint, should be addressed.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\" level=\"0\">  <li><u>Quantum technologies for optronics and RF sensing</u></li> </ol><p>The proposals should address quantum technologies with a potential to improve imaging and optronic sensors by exploiting quantum properties such as superposition, tunnelling and entanglement. In particular, technologies exploiting single photon detection and its processing for seeing behind obstacles in non-line-of-sight configuration and/or in degraded visual environment, such as smoke and dust fog, should be addressed.</p><p>The proposals should also address quantum technologies with a potential to improve RF sensing and electronic warfare, such as ensembles of atoms in Rydberg state or superconducting quantum devices exploiting interference effects as well as colour centres in crystals or other quantum approaches.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\" level=\"0\">  <li><u>Quantum technologies and/or quantum-resistant cryptography for secure communications</u></li> </ol><p>The proposals should address technologies with a potential to improve secure communications (including for multi-domain operations), such as quantum information networks, quantum cryptography and quantum random number generators, and/or quantum-resistant cryptography (post-quantum cryptography, PQC).</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>   <ul level=\"1\"><li>For quantum information networks, techniques for using different transmission media such as fibre optics, free-space or water, including interface between different networks, may be addressed. Technologies to enable long-distance communication, such as quantum memories and entanglement swapping capabilities for quantum repeaters or high-precision pointing and optics for free-space quantum communications, should be covered.</li><li>For quantum cryptography, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) as cryptographic solutions, standardisation of quantum cryptographic protocols and interfaces, interoperability with other technologies (e.g., PQC), security certification of physical hardware border-node between quantum network domains, better SWaP and cost (SWaP-C) properties of the different quantum components (photodetectors, lasers, attenuators, modulators, etc.), connectivity and interfaces with classical devices needed for encryption/decryption of the sensitive data and for the management of the keys once generated such as Key Management Systems (KMS) and encryptors and development of photonic materials platforms for large scale integration.</li><li>For quantum random number generators, challenges to be addressed include the need to increase the bit rate, the improvement of the form factor, miniaturise the devices, and extend the operational range.</li><li>For quantum-resistant cryptography, several algorithms and approaches such as lattice-based, multivariate, hash-based and code-based cryptography may be addressed, as well as crypto-agility mechanisms. Challenges to be addressed include standardisation and integration or hybridisation between quantum and non-quantum algorithms. The combination with quantum cryptography and quantum networks may be covered.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The proposals must identify defence use cases and justify the relevance of the technologies proposed to be addressed with respect to these use cases, taking into account the wider landscape of potential solutions for these use cases and the deployment costs.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to enhancing the readiness of the EU Member States and the European Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) for any further development of state-of-the-art future air-to-air missiles, by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Boosting missile technology within the EDTIB.</li><li>Improving the Member States\u2019 and EDF Associated Countries\u2019 understanding of operational requirements for a FSRM, including benefits from key technologies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Air-to-air combat is a challenging and interdisciplinary field in a high-threat and time-critical environment. The air-to-air missiles currently in service are generally of a good technological standard. However, the requirements for all aspects of such missiles are constantly increasing in number and complexity. Given this environment, it is conceivable that future air-to-air missiles will need to be designed and operate differently.</p><p>The key challenge is to prepare for the development of a missile that can counter future air threats on an economically viable basis.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The main objective is therefore to develop at European level concepts and operational requirements for a short-range air-to-air missile (SRAAM) to primarily counter modern 5<sup>th</sup> and future 6<sup>th</sup> generation combat aircraft and other airborne threats, such as UAS and cruise missiles. Opportunities and limitations are to be explored in various disciplines, such as image processing, target detection, navigation sensors, missile hardware related to kinematic properties, propulsion, warhead unit design, missile guidance, missile control, multi-sensor data fusion, missile computer architecture design, advanced materials (e.g., morphing materials), new production techniques and network integration.</p><p>The research activities performed are expected to mature relevant technologies up to TRL 5-6.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the definition of requirements for a Future Short-Range Missile (FSRM) to be primarily used on combat aircraft for air-to-air applications, as well as a modular interceptor concept to minimise impact on aircraft integration and maximise internal carriage capacity.</p><p>In addition, proposals must address the possibility to use the FSRM or its components for a ground-based air defence application.</p><p>The proposals may also explore combined mode operations (i.e., air-to-air and air-to-ground) for the FSRM.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following

tracking, as well as, but not limited to, image processing, infrared imaging seeker, navigation sensors, guidance laws, missile hardware structure, propulsion, war head unit design, fusing, guidance and control, multi-sensor data fusion, missile computer architecture.</li><li>Define missile concepts and evaluate them against the identified operational requirements, including the use of a standardised missile simulation.</li><li>Analyse the extent to which the FSRM can be economically viable in terms of low development, maintenance, integration and production costs, with a consistent European supply chain, including during a prolonged active conflict.</li><li>Analyse the operational and technical requirements for the FSRM or its components to be used for a ground-based air defence application.</li><li>Analyse the possibility of using a close loop follow on support based on a state-of-the-art prognostics and health management methodology of the FSRM.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>In addition, proposals may also analyse any operational and technical requirements in view of possible combined (i.e., air-to-air and air-to-ground) operations for the FSRM.</p><p><em><strong>Functional requirements</strong></em></p><p>The proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The envisioned FSRM should achieve a high kill probability against a variety of airborne threats, primarily against modern 5th and future 6th generation combat aircraft as well as UAS and cruise missiles, but other airborne threats may also be considered (e.g., large aircraft, light attack aircraft, helicopters, medium-range air defence missiles, air-to-air missiles and similar threats/objects, etc.);</li><li>It should include High Off-Boresight (HOBS) abilities and lock-on after launch capabilities;</li><li>It should be resilient to countermeasures, depending on the technologies foreseen for the FRSM and for the targeted aerial threats;</li><li>Model assessment should be performed in a simulation-driven environment with digital-twin missile concept.</li> </ul><p class=\"eui-u-font-s\">[1] </p>"],

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the emergence of a consolidated EU perspective for U-CCA systems in EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries and for the EDTIB;</li><li>reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution;</li><li>more effective multi-role and networked operations, including MUM-T, collaborative operations in spectrum-constrained environments and swarming formation;</li><li>improvement of the degree of autonomy of unmanned systems, while still allowing humans to take control whenever needed;</li><li>increase operational capability by identifying new concepts and options for dispersed basing of U-CCAs;</li><li>the identification of potential \u201cquick-wins\u201d in the context of U-CCA solutions;</li><li>the generation of prerequisites and inputs for the long-term development of future EU/NATO U-CCA perspective, with a view to reduce the fragmentation in EU UAS fleets;</li><li>air combat solutions able to reduce the exposure of risk to humans, with a more precise effectiveness to reduce the collateral effects;</li><li>the interoperability between EU armed forces and with NATO Allies.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>It is an overarching challenge for the EU and EDF Associated Countries to develop a consolidated common perspective on the long-term applications, requirements, solution concepts and technology needs for an advanced EU Unmanned Collaborative Combat Aircraft (U-CCA) system to support the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> generation fighter in a highly contested A2/AD environment, also in regards to interoperability with NATO.</p><p>U-CCA systems could be conceived as unmanned aerial multirole systems, part of a System of System (SoS), aimed at combined air operations, which are able to act in teaming with lower autonomy levels agents and manned platforms in order to execute tasks in various operational scenarios, while revealing extended survivability capability.</p><p>Although development studies have been underway for some time in the main European aeronautical companies, with the financial support of the respective EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries, the added value of this topic lies in the development of a common vision for a U-CCA system and its related high-level requirements.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to explore technologies, concepts, products, processes and services related to U-CCA systems in different possible configurations. These U-CCA systems are expected to be combat ready, hence highly manoeuvrable and, depending on the mission assigned, they should also be able to collect multispectral information from large areas, while identifying and countering potential threats in a wide range of missions including, but not limited to, defensive and offensive counter air, anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD), in a highly contested environment.</p><p>The U-CCA system should therefore be characterised by a high degree of autonomy and operational effectiveness, a large reconfigurable payload capacity and a flight envelope that allows teaming with fighters, including, but not limited to, with 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> generation, and support to other future aerial platforms in the context of a SoS approach for future combined air operations, including its expendability in specific imputable scenarios. </p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address feasibility studies and preliminary design to explore new/improved concepts, configurations, mission architectures, flight and mission functions, disruptive technologies related to U-CCA systems, and trusted autonomy levels for effective networked operations including manned-unmanned teaming (MUM-T) in demanding denied/contested environments.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcomes can not only have a positive impact on a wide range of military activities, but may also have a dual use potential. They should in particular contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced decision-making for operational planning activities such as targeting activities, planning of indirect fires or aerial bombings over enemy positions in urban areas, while limiting the risks of collateral damages.</li><li>Vulnerability assessment, protection, and improvement of own infrastructure and prediction of impacts on infrastructure and operations due to e.g., natural hazards such as seismic events and tsunamis.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>The effects of attacks on structures such as buildings, plants, oil tanks, pipelines, bridges, dams, etc., are a common subject of concern to military planners and engineers, weaponeers, munition designers, battle damage assessors, and modelling and simulation analysts and developers. However, predicting such effects currently involves a large uncertainty due to the difficulty in estimating the relevant characteristics of these structures. There is therefore a need to efficiently estimate such characteristics from available data such as imagery or documentation and to combine them with effect prediction models to provide reliable predictions. During operations, this should be performed in a limited time and possibly with limited available computing power. This is especially important for relatively large urban areas including many structures.</p><p>Software solutions for automated structural modelling and effect prediction should therefore be developed. They should offer the best possible accuracy, and trust should be ensured in the measurement of their performances. Given the complexity of the task, they need to rely not only on physics-based models but also on artificial intelligence, and they should be evaluated in an objective manner on data that is representative of the targeted use cases. This involves the collection and annotation of representative data. In order to ensure the reproducibility of experiments and for economic reasons, it is important that such data is reusable for similar developments, including by other technology developers. It also involves the testing of systems on new data using documented metrics and testing protocols, in a way that ensures comparability with similar systems developed by such other actors.</p><p>Models for the prediction of effects of weapons on structures are often used in conjunction with other models in decision support tools, for example to estimate freedom of manoeuvre or effectiveness of communication. Scalability and compatibility with such other models and tools should therefore be ensured.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development and evaluation of software systems for modelling structures from multisource imagery and other relevant available data, and for accurately predicting the effects of weapons on these structures. This includes the collection of relevant databases for training and testing the systems.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Generating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Research on automatic and semi-automatic modelling of structures from imagery and other relevant sources of information, as well as on effect prediction models, aiming at optimising the overall accuracy of effect predictions.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Integrating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Collection and annotation of representative data enabling to train and test the systems.</li><li>Integration of the system processing modules into demonstrators.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>In addition, the proposals may also cover the following tasks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Generating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Participation in objective and comparative evaluation campaigns or technological challenges, notably those that may be organised in the context of the EDF call topic EDF-2024-LS-RA-CHALLENGE-SPACE-MSIAO on <em>Multi-source satellite image analysis</em>;</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities with foreseen, ongoing, or completed activities in the fields of automated structural modelling and effect prediction.</p><p><em><strong>Functional requirements</strong></em></p><p>The proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Systems should take as input various sources of information such as satellite or aerial images (optical, IR, radar, SAR, LiDAR, etc.) and documentation if available, and estimate structural features, such as position, dimensions and composition in terms of materials of structures in specified areas.

They should enable users to estimate the degree of damage to targeted structures and their surroundings, as a function of the nature and size of the weapons used. They should also enable to estimate the potential levels of casualties depending on the nature of an attack and of the estimated human presence in a given area. Secondary effects such as window shattering should be taken into account.</li><li>The models should lead to maximum accuracy prediction on representative databases. Reproducibility of the measurements should be ensured, by participating in existing technological challenges whenever relevant, or by organising test campaigns open to other actors if needed.</li><li>The databases foreseen for training and testing the systems should be described in the proposals. These databases should be reusable beyond the project. The foreseen organisational and technical framework for such data sharing should be described in the proposals. In particular, the entity or entities in charge of the data production and distribution should be clearly identified in the proposals.</li><li>Systems should allow non-expert users to evaluate effects of a certain threat over a specific target. They should also provide signatures of such targets, e.g., radar signatures. Systems should also be able to use expert user inputs in order to produce structural models in a semi-supervised manner. Demonstrators should include a user interface enabling these users to supervise the model production.</li><li>Models and systems should be scalable and compatible with broader models supporting decision making beyond the prediction of attack effects.</li> </ul>"], "identifier": ["EDF-2024-RA-DIGIT-ASMEP"], "es_ContentType": ["text/plain"], "programmePeriod": ["2021 - 2027"], "deadlineDate": ["2024-11-05T00:00:00.000+0100"], "es_Combine": ["1"], "esST_URL": ["https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/data/topicDetails/EDF-2024-RA-DIGIT-ASMEP.json"], "tags": [], "esDA_QueueDate": ["2024-09-10T11:59:55.968+0200"], "mission": [], "destinationDescription": [], "actions": ["[{\"types\":[{\"typeOfAction\":\"EDF-RA EDF Research Actions\",\"typeOfMGA\":[{\"id\":44175699,\"abbreviation\":\"EDF-AG\",\"description\":\"EDF Action Grant Budget-Based\"}]}],\"status\":{\"id\":31094502,\"abbreviation\":\"Open\",\"description\":\"Open\"},\"plannedOpeningDate\":\"2024-06-20\",\"submissionProcedure\":{\"id\":31094504,\"abbreviation\":\"single-stage\",\"description\":\"single-stage\"},\"deadlineDates\":[\"2024-11-05\"]}]"], "startDate": ["2024-06-20T00:00:00.000+0200"], "deadlineModel": ["single-stage"], "status": ["31094502"], "supportInfo": ["<p>For help related to this&nbsp;<b>call</b>, please contact:&nbsp;<font color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><a href=\"http://DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu\" target=\"_blank\">DEFIS-EDF-PROPOSALS@ec.europa.eu</a></font></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/faq;grantAndTendertype=1;categories=p_submission_eval;programme=null;actions=;keyword=;period=null\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal FAQ</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Submission of proposals.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/helpdesks/contact-form\">IT Helpdesk</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Contact the IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/funding-tenders-opportunities/display/OM/Online+Manual\">Online Manual</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Step-by-step online guide through the Portal processes from proposal preparation and submission to reporting on your on-going project.

minimum collateral damage for engaging selected difficult-to-identify/acquire targets;</li><li>Engage critical and time sensitive areas and point targets including threat air defence, missile launchers, tactical operation centres and assembly areas;</li><li>European tangible capabilities in intelligent weaponry and ammunition systems for different missions;</li><li>EU mastery of technological building blocks and strategic autonomy on smart ammunition;</li><li>Ensure EU capability in smart guided/precision ammunition for different applications.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>In the context of future armed conflicts, greater focus is likely to be placed on the precision, the effectiveness and the affordability of ammunition and missiles in order to increase the capacity to neutralise adversary forces while avoiding unintended casualties and collateral damages among friendly units and non-combatant third parties.</p><p>Research activities to develop for next generation of European intelligent ammunition is required to enhance Member States precision strike capabilities.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>There is a request to extend the range of ground artillery, rockets and missiles, while increasing their precision. Currently, existing solutions to correct the course of gun launched ammunition are either ITAR or do not fully achieve the required precision. European related research efforts have been modest in the past years. A few concepts have matured to become commercialised products, though with limited performance.</p><p>This topic aims to pave the way for the development of an autonomous European state-of-the-art capability in the field of high precision weaponry, such as guided mortar and artillery ammunition (shells and rockets), missiles, and other munitions with loitering capabilities. Such systems should aim to increase precision in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-contested/denied environments, reduce dependency on non-EU satellite navigation, and improve terminal guidance and effects on targets at extended ranges, as well as providing more affordable solutions. The use of data fusion techniques and high accuracy Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems for Inertial Measurement Units (MEMS IMU) should be considered.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Technologies for increasing ammunition precision guidance, navigation and control, particularly in GNSS-contested/denied environments.</li><li>Technologies for improving terminal guidance of ammunition, in particular for engaging moving targets at speed and concealed targets.</li><li>Technologies for maximising effects on targets at extended ranges, with the possibility of scaling effects, abort mission or re-targeting during flight.</li> </ul><p> In addition, proposals should address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>High accuracy, MEMS IMU and data fusion techniques.</li><li>Navigation solution based on GNSS should have Galileo PRS as main source of positioning and timing.</li><li>Terminal guidance capabilities (e.g., based on Semi-active laser (SAL) or image guidance systems like Imaging infrared (IIR)).</li> </ul><p>Furthermore, proposals may address:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Concepts for introducing guidance or course correction to legacy munitions by using existing interfaces, such as the fuze-well in artillery shells.</li><li>Technologies for loitering capability.</li><li>Technologies for collaborating/swarm with other munition capability.</li> </ul><p>AI algorithms applied to guidance, navigation and control, even to moving targets and target detection.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional

The system should be Cyber resilient;</li><li>Performances should be achieved without modifying the requirement of existing European launchers;</li><li>In case of a concept based on course-correction fuze, it should be aimed at replacing traditional fuzes on standard artillery ammunition with a combined fusing and guidance kit and preferably shallow fuze-well compatibility;</li><li>Ammunition safety of use should be as high as possible, as per the best standards related to life duration and insensitiveness to aggressions. Compliance with NATO STANAG 4439 (related to insensitive munition) and STANAG 4187 (related to safety) should be ensured as far as possible;</li><li>Open architecture and modularity should be applied on smart guided ammunition families, allowing different software versions (algorithms / libraries) to be loaded in the same hardware version;</li><li>ITAR-free in all components.

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>This outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Foster a multi-national European footprint.</li><li>The European Technological growth, connecting FMTC to existing Air Systems and future civil programmes.</li><li>Close capability gaps in line with the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries\u2019 operational needs, providing an alternative to aged fleets.</li><li>Ensure technology maturity and insertion for a mid-2030\u2019s tactical mid-sized cargo aircraft solution.</li><li>Reinforce the European strategic autonomy in the military transport segment.</li><li>Develop vital military capabilities in highly contested environments (e.g., tactical transport, airdrop, air assault) against technologically advanced adversaries.</li><li>Develop EU MEDEVAC capabilities and EU disaster relief, and sanitary crisis response capabilities.</li><li>Promote and secure the European technological and industrial ecosystem, based on a potential new aircraft development.</li><li>Enhance cross-border collaboration (from large industrial groups to SMEs) through the opportunities offered by the several elements of the platform and its architecture.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Tactical transport aircrafts are the workhorses of battlefields, fulfilling missions like airdrop delivery, parachutist drop, logistics, medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), air to air refuelling, special missions under harsh and adverse conditions, which are critical for the success of military operations. Operations in hostile environments demand e.g., built in electronic warfare self-protection systems, and set requirements on the platform performance/build up in order to be suitable for the task, and furthermore to operate with limited ground infrastructure (e.g., unprepared runways).</p><p>Beyond their pure military role, tactical transport aircrafts are also key assets for a better civil defence/protection and EU-internal needs, with critical contribution to disaster relief, search-and-rescue, and sanitary crises response.</p><p>Besides the A400M, which is on the high-performance side of the capacity, the initial conception of the majority of currently operating tactical aircraft (C130) is now 40 years old, and there is a need for a new medium tactical European aircraft, lighter than the A400M that could provide a complementary capacity for tactical transport.</p><p>Currently, some EU Member States are operating medium payload tactical military transport -aircrafts within their fleet, which can be replaced with growing capabilities, able to cope with the envisaged operational challenges.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic is an opportunity for Europe to federate efforts by providing the EU defence community (EU Members States, EDF Associated Countries and industry) with robust elements to decide what the 2035+ future of EU military tactical transport could be.</p><p>By maturation of the required technologies and innovations, this topic aims to lower the risks for the Future Mid-size Tactical Cargo aircraft (FMTC) capability development and therefore the costs for further potential development phases, with a view to possibly enabling first flight of prototype early 2030\u2019s.</p><span

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>More precise and valid situational awareness information through the flexible use of cognitive capabilities in an RF sensor system combining multiple functions like radar, electronic warfare and, (when viable and beneficial) communications, through multiple bands and agile waveforms, working in active or passive modes to strengthen the recognised air/ground/maritime picture.</li><li>Standardisation of hardware, waveforms, software, data transmission protocols, data format, procedures etc., within the framework of an interoperable, modular and scalable architecture, in order to increase interoperability among participating parties and existing or designed products.</li><li>Reduction of the electromagnetic spectrum use and achievement of the higher level of survivability of the overall system, and particularly for the platforms involved, through the development and integration of cognitive capabilities.</li><li>Demonstration of the capacity and feasibility of the different innovations developed in the project through tangible and measurable results.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>New types of threats are difficult to detect and track, in particular those with stealth characteristics, hypersonic speeds, slow airborne motion, small highly manoeuvring and when saturation attack tactics are used. Facing such threats, existing surveillance radar systems are reaching their limits in terms of detection range, angular domain coverage, tracking and recognition capabilities. Consequently, the objective of this topic is to mature the required technologies and concepts to cover the need for situational awareness by achieving advanced high-performance and a highly integrated multifunction system that may support radar, electronic warfare (EW) and possibly communication functions when feasible and advantageous, enabled through the development of active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic addresses the maturation of new RF sensor technologies, such as, but not limited to, high-power, high-frequency (up to Ka band), multi and wide band operation both active and passive, adaptive waveform design, modern AESA antennas with digital beam-forming, advanced resource management, innovative signal processing and spectrum-sensing techniques, multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) radar, multi-static configurations and cognitive capabilities with for instance Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML). The aim is to render radars highly versatile and adaptive, while being compatible with operational constraints in terms of performance, size, weight, power consumption and cost (SWaPC).</p><p>These advances are expected to continue paving the way for more integrated capabilities with respect to radiofrequency (RF), microwaves and electronics, permitting the integration of the functions of radar, electronic warfare and desirably communications into existing or new platforms when feasible and advantageous. The specific understanding, development and management of AESA antennas is essential in this regard.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address research on innovative RF sensor technologies able to improve the performance of current radar systems and deepen into the concept of multifunctional capabilities when feasible and efficient.</p><p>As agreed with supporting Member States and EDF Associated Countries, challenging scenarios must be proposed, Associated Countries, after being analysed by using different combinations of radar techniques and selected as the most appropriate solutions in terms of performance, feasibility and cost. In that regard, the proposals should consider active and/or passive RF systems, stationary and/or mobile, single band and/or multiband using a wide coverage of the spectrum, multiplatform, adaptive and flexible with cognitive capabilities that suppose a strong impact and significant effects in the theatre of operations, increasing survivability, interoperability and resilience of the EU Member States\u2019 and EDF Associated Countries\u2019 Armed Forces.</p><p>This set of technologies should be conceived to be integrated in different platforms and with the capacity to be part of a network able to cover wider areas and work synergistically in order to improve the detection, tracking and identification capabilities of challenging targets. Examples of those are the stealthy ones (low RCS), tactical ballistic missiles (TBM) and hypersonic missiles, or when saturation attack tactics are used and targets are immersed in clutter or protected by jamming.</p><p>Proposals should not address the network aspects.</p><p>The improvement of the technological enablers of the AESA antennas should be covered as a mean to allow the multifunctional concepts and improve the general performance of the radar against new types of threats.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Generating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Development of novel algorithms and methods for the previously mentioned challenging scenarios including difficult functionalities.

Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution;</li><li>future establishment of a European RF-CMOS fine pitch supply chain for defence;</li><li>secure the autonomy and non-dependent availability of critical analogue and digital functional building blocks in the next generations of digital wideband AESA RF systems;</li><li>gained knowledge regarding design and manufacturing of RF-CMOS as required for defence applications;</li><li>shared awareness on the need for RF-CMOS at European level as a basis for increased production volume for fine pitch chips in line with defence needs.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>European competitiveness is increasingly dependent on the development of electronics. In recent years, the opportunities offered by Systems-On-a-Chip have become very apparent in many different technology sectors such as telecommunications, military, automotive, financial, medical research, and others.</p><p>Fundamental to this development is the integration of processing hardware, embedded programming software and firmware and high-speed digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital technology with low power consumption technology into a single component.</p><p>There is a need to invest in a European RF-CMOS supply chain and measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations connected to military applications. Building on the learnings from the GaN-supply chain cooperation, and based on the growing demand for integrated circuits, a European supply chain initiative, catalysed by military needs, is likely to become a very important tool for future European prosperity and for ensuring a long-term strategy of non-dependence for critical defence technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply and to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies. The action should define strategies for development and ownership of advanced RF-CMOS supply chain in Europe, possibly a European Silicon foundry base aiming for advanced technology nodes for analog (RF) and digital circuits, as well as technologies or methodologies that enable use of other foundries without compromising assurance, where assurance pertains to both availability of the supply chain and its security.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope consists of two interacting parts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The development of RF-CMOS components and modules connected to current and future military applications, including the requirements for a production supply chain.</li><li>How a non-dependent RF-CMOS European supply chain could be gained, or at least how measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations, high cost for low volume production or other limiting factor for a European supply chain can be implemented. A European supply chain must, but is not limited to, include one or more RF-CMOS fabrication site(s), mask generation, supply of wafers and other important raw materials necessary for advanced RF-CMOS processing. It may also include packaging and testing facilities.</li> </ul><p>Proposals must include studies, such as feasibility studies to explore new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions.</p><p>Proposals should identify which components and modules are relevant for future systems and which manufacturing facilities are needed for such components and modules.</p><p>The action should develop a strategy for a European RF-CMOS fine pitch supply chain for manufacturing of high-speed and high-performance functional building blocks (data converters and FPGA) in the next generations of digital AESA Radar, wideband multifunctional RF systems. The nodes for each circuit (analog and digital) could be different to optimise the performance and be assembled with a system in package technology.</p><p>Taking in account the existing European manufacturing facilities and the civil programs such as CHIP JU, proposals should propose a design with a view to ensure:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The non-dependence for defence systems integrating this RF-CMOS solution.</li><li>The cost efficiency of the solution for low volume quantities (including NRE).</li> </ul><p>The proposals must avoid unnecessary duplications with other EU, intergovernmental

["<span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcome should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution;</li><li>future establishment of a European RF-CMOS fine pitch supply chain for defence;</li><li>secure the autonomy and non-dependent availability of critical analogue and digital functional building blocks in the next generations of digital wideband AESA RF systems;</li><li>gained knowledge regarding design and manufacturing of RF-CMOS as required for defence applications;</li><li>shared awareness on the need for RF-CMOS at European level as a basis for increased production volume for fine pitch chips in line with defence needs.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>European competitiveness is increasingly dependent on the development of electronics. In recent years, the opportunities offered by Systems-On-a-Chip have become very apparent in many different technology sectors such as telecommunications, military, automotive, financial, medical research, and others.</p><p>Fundamental to this development is the integration of processing hardware, embedded programming software and firmware and high-speed digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital technology with low power consumption technology into a single component.</p><p>There is a need to invest in a European RF-CMOS supply chain and measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations connected to military applications. Building on the learnings from the GaN-supply chain cooperation, and based on the growing demand for integrated circuits, a European supply chain initiative, catalysed by military needs, is likely to become a very important tool for future European prosperity and for ensuring a long-term strategy of non-dependence for critical defence technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply and to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies. The action should define strategies for development and ownership of advanced RF-CMOS supply chain in Europe, possibly a European Silicon foundry base aiming for advanced technology nodes for analog (RF) and digital circuits, as well as technologies or methodologies that enable use of other foundries without compromising assurance, where assurance pertains to both availability of the supply chain and its security.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The scope consists of two interacting parts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The development of RF-CMOS components and modules connected to current and future military applications, including the requirements for a production supply chain.</li><li>How a non-dependent RF-CMOS European supply chain could be gained, or at least how measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations, high cost for low volume production or other limiting factor for a European supply chain can be implemented. A European supply chain must, but is not limited to, include one or more RF-CMOS fabrication site(s), mask generation, supply of wafers and other important raw materials necessary for advanced RF-CMOS processing. It may also include packaging and testing facilities.</li> </ul><p>Proposals must include studies, such as feasibility studies to explore new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions.</p><p>Proposals should identify which components and modules are relevant for future systems and which manufacturing facilities are needed for such components and modules.</p><p>The action should develop a strategy for a European RF-CMOS fine pitch supply chain for manufacturing of high-speed and high-performance functional building blocks (data converters and FPGA) in the next generations of digital AESA Radar, wideband multifunctional RF systems. The nodes for each circuit (analog and digital) could be different to optimise the performance and be assembled with a system in package technology.</p><p>Taking in account the existing European manufacturing facilities and the civil programs such as CHIP JU, proposals should propose a design with a view to ensure:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The non-dependence for defence systems integrating this RF-CMOS solution.</li><li>The cost efficiency of the solution for low volume quantities (including NRE).</li> </ul><p>The proposals must avoid unnecessary duplications with other EU, intergovernmental

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcomes should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>Faster and better planning and decision making (with less personnel) during mission planning and execution, resulting in higher mission success.</li><li>Leverage Reinforcement Learning towards largely automating the modelling and implementation of expert-level (or beyond) competent battlespace agents, thereby greatly reducing the time and cost of course of action (COA) development and wargaming.</li><li>Deliver a proof-of-concept demonstrator at least of TRL 5.</li><li>Increase the opportunities for various smaller actors, including those not previously active in the defence sector, to adapt and apply innovative simulation technologies for defence applications.</li><li>Increase business opportunities in the defence sector for EU and Associated Countries companies and promote technological edge in the field.</li><li>Increasing the interoperability between EU armed forces and with NATO Allies.</li><li>Increase opportunities and future involvement for third parties participating in FSTP in the field of simulation and training within tasks described previously in the call text under \u201cConditions related to FSTP\u201d.</li> </ul><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Mission planning and execution in the present and future multi-domain operation environment (MDO) employing manned and unmanned force elements demand that the human decision makers are very well supported to be able to handle the complexity and dynamics of the battlespace and make decisions faster and better than the adversary.</p><p>In mission planning different types of operational capabilities need to be carefully coordinated in time and space to achieve mission goals and counter expected threats. Labour intensive manual planning is infeasible within the constraints of available time and resources. The general objective is to develop advanced automated support tools for the generation and evaluation of courses of action (COAs) in an MDO context. The toolset is expected to support wargaming of the candidate COAs to ensure that commanders and staff can assess the plan and options in detail before final decision making.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This call aims to explore technologies, concepts, products, processes and services towards a common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations with the potential to facilitate reinforcement learning for mission planning and execution support.</p><p>Re-planning and decision-making during mission execution are likely to be challenged in the interconnected, manned-unmanned, automated and high-speed battlespace. In the future, the clear distinction between mission planning and execution is expected to be challenged by exploiting battlespace information and predictive capabilities. Proper support is needed to speed up the OODA-loop to outpace the adversary in the planning phase as well as in the execution phase.</p><p>The development and use of a computer-based decision support system that leverages AI, machine learning, wargames/combat simulations and digital twins of the battlespace has the potential to change the military planning and decision-making concept of operations (CONOPS).</p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown a huge potential for solving planning problems in civilian applications. However, despite its headline success in video games, strategy games and other planning domains over the last few years, RL is not making similar progresses in the realm of wargames/combat simulations for military operations planning. Videogames leave a lot of margin when it comes to critical (life or death) simulation. Nevertheless, if access to classified data from the field is not possible, videogames data may be used for a proof of concept.<em> </em></p><p>Simulation frameworks tailored to particular domains have played a major role in facilitating reinforcement learning in those domains, as witnessed by the impact of e.g., OpenAI Gym and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).</p><p>A common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations has the potential of similarly facilitating reinforcement learning\u2013support in mission planning and execution.</p><p>As it is related to EUDIS, this topic aims to support, in addition to the research activities, the creation of an innovation test hub in the field of simulation and training. To achieve this objective, financial support to third parties (cascade funding) (FSTP) is included as part of the grant. This should increase the opportunities for various smaller actors, including those not previously active in the defence sector, to adapt innovative simulation technologies for defence applications and to identify potential business opportunities in the defence sector.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address studies and design of a reinforcement learning environment/testbed or framework for training of AI agents to develop courses of actions in mission planning, including a flexible and open combat simulation framework fit for RL. It must address the need for rapid and user-friendly creation of scenarios, considering commander\u2019s objectives and intent, rules of engagement and other mission constraints (e.g., speed, resources, attrition). It must also include studies and design of a combat simulation system (not necessarily the same used for AI agent training) including trained AI agents to support mission planning. For the support to mission execution the scope includes studies and design of a digital twin of the ongoing mission for prediction and decision-making support. The proposal must establish a proof-of-concept demonstrator for verification, validation and demonstration.</p><p>The learning environment, including the combat simulation framework must be flexible and adaptive for different scenarios and domains. It must take advantage of open standards and open-source frameworks both within AI, simulation technologies (including C2-Simulation interoperability) and mission sensor and mission data to the digital twin.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Studies:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Define scenarios and use cases;</li><li>Identify general operational needs and requirements, and more specifically, needs and requirements for simulation support in COA development, evaluation and wargaming.

class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact:</span><p>The outcomes should contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce dependencies on non-European suppliers by boosting the EDTIB and promoting the development of a European solution.</li><li>The strategic autonomy of EDTIB in the area of secured underwater communication.</li><li>The interoperability of EU Member States\u2019 and EDF Associated Countries\u2019 Armed Forces.</li><li>The improvement of protocols and standardisation of underwater communications.</li><li>The improvement of range and bandwidth of underwater communications.</li><li>The improvement of command-and-control systems for unmanned platforms.</li> </ul><p>The improvement of safety and security of underwater communications.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective:</span><p>Efficient, robust, and secured underwater communication is a key enabler for maritime uncrewed systems (MUS), including the use of uncrewed underwater systems (UUS). There is a need for exchange of classified information in MUS. Identification, authentication and authorisation are important functionalities in the field of digital trusted gateways. Further research needs to be done to overcome the physical characteristics of the underwater environment that limits the possibility of having wireless communication systems with sufficient robustness and bandwidth required by many underwater warfare functions.</p><p>The specific objective is to design and demonstrate feasibility of secured (communications security COMSEC and transmission security TRANSEC) underwater (network) communication solutions (acoustic, optical, or other modalities) for UUSs designed for military needs.</p><span class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address research of secure underwater communication, with focus on <strong>acoustic</strong> technologies, including networked solutions, that contribute to the improvement of current performance, through the creation of new low-distortion modulation techniques, interference avoidance/suppression mechanisms, recovery from fading, etc. This requires the communication to be highly adaptive and self-reconfigurable. To improve the performance of the acoustic underwater communication channel, the environmental conditions in situ, such as noise, depth, sound velocity profile, etc., must be considered.</p><p>Furthermore, research in underwater communication, with focus on <strong>optical</strong> technologies, must be addressed, with the aim of improving bandwidth and transmission distance, reducing signal distortion, in order to improve communication within and between platforms, networks and infrastructures.</p><p>The security aspects should be included in the underwater communication systems. The challenging communication conditions (low data rate, long latency, delay and Doppler spread effects, highly varying channel conditions and high noise levels, etc), which may result in unreliable and low-bandwidth communication links, also give special challenges for security mechanisms. This should be taken into account in the design of the complete communication system (modulations, network protocols, etc), carefully balancing modular/layered approaches and cross-layer approaches. During the design, performance metrics describing efficiency and robustness should always be assessed, to avoid that this gets too much compromised by the security measures. Also, encryption methods should be considered in order to obtain metrics about its efficiency. Different encryption methods can be used depending on the mission state, data classification level, etc.</p><p>The suggested design solutions should be tested in a realistic environment in salt water.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table>  <thead>   <tr>    <td colspan=\"2\"> <p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p> <p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>(a)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(optional)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(b)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(c)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(d)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p> </td>    <td> <p>Yes(mandatory)</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(e)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(f)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(g)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(h)</p> </td>    <td> <p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p>(i)</p> </td>    <td> <p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p> </td>    <td> <p>No</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Integrating knowledge:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Security techniques integrated or working in tandem with the underwater communication systems, through encryption and/or other methods.
