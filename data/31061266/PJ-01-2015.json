Building on previous work conducted in this area, this action should support Member States\u2019 efforts to reduce alcohol related harm and particularly contribute to the objectives of the Member States\u2019 action plan on Youth Drinking and on Heavy Episodic Drinking. It should generate and promote new and innovative good practices targeting the reduction of heavy episodic drinking amongst young people and encourage networking for building EU and national capacities to successfully reduce availability of alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The activities should aim at testing methods/tools and at identifying good practices on reducing heavy episodic drinking amongst young people in different settings and different Member States through measures reducing availability of alcoholic drinks. The activities would also analyse the impact of such measures reducing availability (in terms of reducing harmful alcohol use, in particular heavy episodic drinking amongst young people). Priority should be given to initiatives aiming at identifying good practices targeting young people among the lowest socioeconomic groups and encourage EU networking and good practise exchange.</p><p>Implementation: Implementation by the Agency;
