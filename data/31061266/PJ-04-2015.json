The aim of this action is to build on the preliminary results of the Partnership, in the areas of integrated care, frailty prevention, adherence to medical plans and age-friendly communities. This action will facilitate the implementation and scaling-up of good practices at local, regional or country level or the exchange of good practices between Member States, supporting the potential of innovation in health and social care by encouraging the integration of health and care and highlighting independent living and participation in the community. The results of this action should show the benefits of moving towards community based health and social care which enables older people to remain active and healthy for longer as well as providing efficient care and treatment when needed. The results will also contribute to an informed decision-making at European level.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Building upon previous work conducted in these areas, the activities to be addressed will include: (i) identification of benchmarks focusing on successful local interventions with high transferability potential and (ii) support to the twinning, coaching, and/or scaling up of identified good practices on: integrating health and social care in age-friendly community settings; community programmes implementing tools and European guidance on age-friendly communities that use a participatory approach and respond to needs of older people; integrated community-based approach programmes for the screening, assessment, prevention and management of frailty in older people, and development of interventions for adherence to treatment and medical plans, in particular involving health care professionals, patients in the community, caregivers and community pharmacies.</p><p>Implementation: Implementation by the Agency;
