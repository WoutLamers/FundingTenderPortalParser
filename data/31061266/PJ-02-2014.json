The aim of this topic is to explore the potential of early diagnosis in view of the control and more efficient treatment of chronic diseases. Technical developments, innovative approaches and progress in medicine lead to improved possibilities to identify the onset and to follow the progression of diseases.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> The projects should develop an overview on where and how new or improved forms of early diagnosis (technical means, diagnostics, indicator diseases... would be effective and efficient interventions for improved control of chronic diseases, and have an impact on the prevention and progression of major chronic diseases. The projects have two main objectives: (a) identify criteria for the use of early diagnosis in health care settings and develop implementation schemes based on an analysis of economic and medical benefits; (b) deliver a comprehensive overview and assessment of major screening and early intervention programmes, highlighting differences and strong and weak points in order to provide recommendations on steps to implement more efficient screening and early diagnosis schemes as prevention programmes in Europe.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Project (HP-PJ)</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding:</span></strong><span style=\"color: #003366\"> </span>Described in section 6 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp_call_proposals_pj2014_en.pdf\">Call document</a>.<span style=\"color: #003366\"> </span><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions</span></strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">: </span>Described in sections 5 and 6 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp_call_proposals_pj2014_en.pdf\">Call document</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </span></strong>3.1 <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</span></strong> Described in sections 8 and 9 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp_call_proposals_pj2014_en.pdf\">Call document</a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    3.2 <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">For submission and evaluation process:</span></strong> <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp-call-guide-app-pj_en.pdf\">Guide for applicants 2014 - projects</a> - 3rd Health Programme (2014-2020)<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> The page limit for the technical proposal is 80.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</span></strong> Please consult the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp_call_proposals_pj2014_en.pdf\">Call document</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic:<br />\r\n    </span></strong><u><span style=\"color: #000000\">Project (HP-PJ):<br />\r\n    </span></u><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp-call-pt-pj_en.pdf\">Standard proposal template</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp-call-ef-pj_en.pdf\">Standard self-evaluation form</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/other_eu_prog/hp/hp-mga_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: #003366\"><strong>Additional provisions:<br />\r\n    </strong></span><span style=\"color: #000000\">Please perform a financial viability self-check, using the PP <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/organisations/lfv.html\">tool of the financial viability self-check</a>. </span><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">Additional documents:<br />\r\n    </span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/health/programme/policy/index_en.htm\">Health Programme Decision</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/health/programme/events/adoption_workplan_2014_en.htm\">Annual work plan 2014</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/financial-regulation-applicable-to-the-general-budget-of-the-union-and-its-rules-of-application-pbKV0113881/?CatalogCategoryID=Y.cKABstnJsAAAEjxZEY4e5L\">EU Financial regulation</a></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<div>\r\n<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html#f05\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;
