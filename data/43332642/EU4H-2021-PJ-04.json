In fact, cancer is the principal cause of death by disease in children beyond the age of one. Up to 30% of children affected by cancer suffer severe long-term consequences. The number of childhood cancer survivors continues to grow and comprehensive care, treatment and follow-up are essential to help young patients make a good recovery and enjoy an optimal quality of life. There is a need for multidisciplinary and proactive approaches to healthy cancer survivorship, as well as for improved social networking and establishment of communication and information sharing platforms tailored specifically to young adult cancer survivors, which are well demonstrated instruments to improve the quality of life of children and young adult cancer survivors.</p><p>This action supports the implementation of the Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan objective to put childhood cancer under the spotlight and implements the EU4health Programme\u2019s general objective of improving and fostering in the Union (Article 3, point(a)) through the specific objectives in Article 4, points (a),(g) and (j) of Regulation (EU)2021/522.</p><p><strong>Objectives pursued</strong><br>The action will improve the quality of life of children and young adult cancer survivors through improved social networking and the use of a platform to improve the links amongst individuals, patients, cancer survivors, and social and health professionals active in cancer prevention and care across the Union.</p><p>Building on the experiences gained by several organisations, non-governmental organisations and cancer care institutions active in childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers, the action has the ambition of establishing the new \u2018EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors\u2019 through federating the mentioned bodies to create a Union-wide platform to support the promotion of targeted actions and initiatives, covering the main areas which are of demonstrated benefit to improve the quality of life of young cancer survivors. The activities will be designed taking into account those key factors that may influence childhood cancer survivors\u2019 participation in social networking and programmes tailored to their needs, such as the resources accessed by individuals through a broad range of social connections (\u2018social capitals of individuals\u2019), social support, family interaction, self-efficacy and self-reported quality of life.</p><p>Children, adolescents and young adult survivors will be at the core of the actions and will be the main actors in linking with their countries and/or organisation. A conference will give the possibility to show and share the results of the activities implemented and on-going across the Union, and to discuss as widely as possible the needs and challenges. The EU Network will also be open to establish international links through direct contacts with partners outside the Union or through links with international organisations. Particular attention will be given to actions limiting the disruptive impact of cancer on the education of children and young people affected by cancer. This will happen with the involvement of patients and of formal and informal carers, on a voluntary basis.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Description of the activities to be funded under this topic</strong><br>The activities funded will be as follow:<br>- Preparatory activities (first 6 months of the initiative).

The EU4Health Regulation established \u2018the EU4Health Programme\u2019. This marks an important step towards making available instruments and solutions to support Member States in building stronger, more resilient and accessible health systems.</p><p>The EU4Health Programme represents an unprecedented level of financial commitment for the EU in health in comparison with previous health programmes. The Programme is EU\u2019s response to the current public health emergency that will make a significant contribution to the post-COVID-19 recovery aiming to:<br>- improve public health in the Union through disease prevention and health promotion, as well as international health initiatives and cooperation;<br>- protect people from serious cross-border health threats through prevention, preparedness and response to cross-border health threats; complementing national stockpiling of essential crisis-relevant products; and establishing a reserve of medical, healthcare and support staff;<br>- improve access to medicinal products, medical devices and crisis-relevant products by encouraging sustainable production and supply chains and innovation in the Union and efficient use of medicinal products;<br>- strengthen the national health systems through improved health data use and re-use, development of digital tools and services, digital transformation of healthcare; enhancing access to healthcare; developing and implementing EU health legislation and evidence-based decision making; and integrated work among Member States\u2019 health systems.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the Member States after cardiovascular disease. The prevention and control of cancer would benefit the majority of citizens since it shares common risk factors with other non-communicable diseases. Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan, which is a key pillar of a stronger European Health Union, tackles the entire cancer disease pathway by means of flagship initiatives, such as launching a Cancer Inequalities Registry, and supporting actions, such as establishing an EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors. The EU4Health programme will provide the financial support to implement these initiatives that are important to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer control and care.</p><p>Grants shall involve co-financing. Grants paid by the Union shall not exceed 60 % of eligible costs for an action relating to an objective of the Programme. In cases of exceptional utility, the contribution by the Union may be up to 80 % of eligible costs.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 29, 2021 11:52:53 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 29, 2021 11:52:53 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EU4H-2021-PJ-03(EU4H-PJG), EU4H-2021-PJ-01(EU4H-PJG), EU4H-2021-PJ-04(EU4H-PJG), EU4H-2021-PJ-02(EU4H-PJG), EU4H-2021-PJ-05(EU4H-PJG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
