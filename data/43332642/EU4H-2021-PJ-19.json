Screening therefore is an important tool in limiting morbidity and improving survival rates of those who have developed cancer. </span></span></p><p><span><span>In the Union, countries have adopted significant measures to deliver cancer screening services to their populations as recommended in the Council Recommendation of 2 December 2003 on cancer screening</span></span>. Screening methodologies are subject to ongoing development and therefore the application of recommended screening approaches and methodologies should be accompanied by simultaneous assessments of the quality, applicability and cost-effectiveness of new methods.</p><p><span><span>Quality assurance at all levels of population-based screening programmes can only be ensured if good information about benefits and risks, adequate resources, follow-up with complementary diagnostic procedures and treatment of those with a positive screening test are available. </span></span></p><p><span>The report on the implementation of the Council Recommendation on cancer screening (2017)</span> demonstrated barriers to access to screening services by the population and also to deliver quality-assured services. These barriers introduce serious inequities at the Union level and the delivery of quality-assured services in a population-based approach still has to be assessed and addressed through pragmatic public health initiatives in many countries.</p><p><span><span>This action supports the implementation of a Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan flagship initiative and implements the EU4Health Programme\u2019s general objective of improving and fostering health in the Union (Article 3, point (a)) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (a) and (j) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.</span></span></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective</SPAN>:<p><strong><span><span>OBJECTIVES PURSUED</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span><span>Activities will include the organisation, implementation and running of accreditation and certification activities making use of guidelines for breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and care. </span></span></span></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong><span><span>DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES TO BE FUNDED UNDER THIS TOPIC</span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>Activities will include the organisation, implementation and running of accreditation and certification activities making use of European guidelines addressing the entire pathway of breast cancer screening, through the use of the work developed by the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC).</span></span> The mentioned activities will be implemented by the successful applicant/consortium of Breast Cancer Services (BCS), and Conformity Assessment Bodies accredited for the European Quality Assurance schemes.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong><span><span>EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT</span></span></strong></p><p>The expected result is the implementation at national and/or regional level of accreditation and certification quality assurance schemes for the entire pathway of breast cancer screening, including diagnosis and care.</p><p><span><span><span>This action will improve the quality and performance of the entire pathway of population-based screening for breast cancer and is expected to pave the way to address cervical and colorectal cancers in subsequent open calls.

The activities will take advantage of the steering support provided by the Commission\u2019s Knowledge Centre on Cancer. In particular the beneficiary(es) will define the entitiesand the Breast Cancer Services which will participate to the pilot phase, taking into consideration the need to include at least 30% services originating from underrepresented territorial/geographical areas,</span> and/or those Breast Cancer Services which still do not have an accreditation certification process for the entire breast cancer care pathway.
