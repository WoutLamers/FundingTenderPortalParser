High-quality cancer care depends on a number of factors including access to essential medicines and innovation.</p><p>The large majority of current radiation technologies used in medicine address cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the quality and safety of these medical applications needs to be harmonised across the Union as it is evident that disparities exist in the applied level of such standards. In addition, the supply of radioisotopes used for cancer diagnosis and treatment is still not constant and subject to interruptions, therefore measures should be developed to ensure their sustainable supply, in particular in the long-term.</p><p>This action supports the Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan objective to ensure high standards in cancer care and implements the EU4Health Programme\u2019s general objective of improving and fostering health in the Union (Article 3, point (a)) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (a) and (g) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.</p><p><strong>Objectives pursued</strong><br>The aim of the action is to enhance the quality and safety and optimise radiation technology in medicine.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Description of the activities to be funded under this topic</strong><br>Applicants shall target their proposal to one or more of the action strands (a, b, c) described below and indicate that clearly in the proposal.</p><p>This action will be implemented in close cooperation with the Strategic Agenda for Medical Ionising Radiation Applications of nuclear and radiation technology (SAMIRA) (SWD(2021)14 final) and the activities will be grouped as follows:</p><p>(a) Quality and safety of medical radiation applications<br>The action will include accompanying activities to:<br>(1) build co-operations, support and monitor medical radiations applications,<br>(2) develop evidence-based guidance and practical tools for quality and safety of medical ionising radiation applications,<br>(3) build EU dose registry for patients undergoing radiological and nuclear medicine imaging, and<br>(4) support to align Euratom / EU action on medical radiological diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, including acceptance and performance testing, technical standards and harmonised reporting of adverse events, align Euratom / EU action on radiopharmaceuticals, and support actions for clinical audit of radiology, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy practices.</p><p>(b) Workforce education and training<br>The action will include activities for the:<br>(1) Union-wide monitoring of workforce availability, education and training;<br>(2) capacity building in modern radionuclide cancer diagnosis, therapy and \u2018theragnostics\u2019; and<br>(3) development of EU curricula and certification schemes in the quality and safety of radiology, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.</p><p>(c) Equal access to modern medical radiation technology and interventions<br>The action will include:<br>(1) monitoring of the Union imaging and radiotherapy equipment base and the availability of modern quality and safety features;<br>(2) develop quality and safety criteria and optimised imaging protocols for advanced medical imaging;<br>(3) cover medical radiation technology, including diagnostic and therapeutic application, in national cancer plans; and<br>(4) improve evidence for clinical efficacy of novel cancer interventions involving ionising radiation.</p><p>Applicants have to ensure co-ordination with other SAMIRA actions, in order to avoid duplication of activities. In particular, applicants should take into account the Directorate General for Energy\u2019s calls for tenders on medical equipment and co-ordinated implementation of the legal bases for nuclear medicine and radiopharmaceuticals.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong>Expected results and impact</strong><br>The action will contribute to improve the quality and safety of medical radiation applications, the standards of the workforce in the radio-nuclear medical sector through education and training, and it will facilitate a more equal access to modern medical radiation technology and interventions.</p><p>In addition, the action will help to better align Euratom and EU health actions on important issues such as safety and quality in medical and radiation applications and in radiopharmaceuticals. It will contribute to a reduction in discrepancies through a shared and harmonised approach to current radiation technology for medical applications to address cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>This action will ultimately benefit cancer patients and the general population in accessing radiology and nuclear medicine services in the Member States.</p><p><strong>Specific mandatory deliverables and/or milestones</strong><br>Participants in the action have to regularly report on the progress of the work to the Steering Group on Quality and Safety of medical applications of nuclear and radiation technology (SGQS), to be launched under the SAMIRA action plan by the end of 2021. Indicatively, this will include providing short written updates and presentations to the SGQS once every six months for the duration of the project.</p><p><strong>Specific action-level indicators for reporting purposes</strong><br>The applicants will include the following specific action-level indicators and related reporting activities in their proposals:</p><p>Quality and safety of medical radiation applications<br>- number of experts and organisations involved, by type of application;<br>- number of manuals / guidance / relevant documents produced;<br>- number of practical tools deployed, by type of application;<br>- number of countries and imaging departments included in the EU dose registry.</p><p>Workforce education and training<br>- number of training materials produced;<br>- number of training courses organised (days);<br>- number of professionals trained, by category;<br>- satisfaction rate of trained professionals.</p><p>Equal access to modern radiation technology and interventions<br>- number of reports produced;<br>- number of recommendations endorsed;<br>- number of national cancer plans covering imaging and therapeutic equipment;<br>- number of protocols agreed/endorsed.</p><p>The applicants are required to include in their proposals additional specific action-level indicators which will be agreed with the HaDEA during the grant agreement preparation.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/eu4h/wp-call/2021/call-fiche_eu4h-2021-pj_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/eu4h/wp-call/2021/call-fiche_eu4h-2021-pj_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/eu4h/wp-call/2021/call-fiche_eu4h-2021-pj_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

The EU4Health Regulation established \u2018the EU4Health Programme\u2019. This marks an important step towards making available instruments and solutions to support Member States in building stronger, more resilient and accessible health systems.</p><p>The EU4Health Programme represents an unprecedented level of financial commitment for the EU in health in comparison with previous health programmes. The Programme is EU\u2019s response to the current public health emergency that will make a significant contribution to the post-COVID-19 recovery aiming to:<br>- improve public health in the Union through disease prevention and health promotion, as well as international health initiatives and cooperation;<br>- protect people from serious cross-border health threats through prevention, preparedness and response to cross-border health threats; complementing national stockpiling of essential crisis-relevant products; and establishing a reserve of medical, healthcare and support staff;<br>- improve access to medicinal products, medical devices and crisis-relevant products by encouraging sustainable production and supply chains and innovation in the Union and efficient use of medicinal products;<br>- strengthen the national health systems through improved health data use and re-use, development of digital tools and services, digital transformation of healthcare; enhancing access to healthcare; developing and implementing EU health legislation and evidence-based decision making; and integrated work among Member States\u2019 health systems.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the Member States after cardiovascular disease. The prevention and control of cancer would benefit the majority of citizens since it shares common risk factors with other non-communicable diseases. Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan, which is a key pillar of a stronger European Health Union, tackles the entire cancer disease pathway by means of flagship initiatives, such as launching a Cancer Inequalities Registry, and supporting actions, such as establishing an EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors. The EU4Health programme will provide the financial support to implement these initiatives that are important to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer control and care.</p><p>Grants shall involve co-financing.
