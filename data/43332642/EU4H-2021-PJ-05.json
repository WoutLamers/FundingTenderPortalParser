The EU4Health Regulation established \u2018the EU4Health Programme\u2019. This marks an important step towards making available instruments and solutions to support Member States in building stronger, more resilient and accessible health systems.</p><p>The EU4Health Programme represents an unprecedented level of financial commitment for the EU in health in comparison with previous health programmes. The Programme is EU\u2019s response to the current public health emergency that will make a significant contribution to the post-COVID-19 recovery aiming to:<br>- improve public health in the Union through disease prevention and health promotion, as well as international health initiatives and cooperation;<br>- protect people from serious cross-border health threats through prevention, preparedness and response to cross-border health threats; complementing national stockpiling of essential crisis-relevant products; and establishing a reserve of medical, healthcare and support staff;<br>- improve access to medicinal products, medical devices and crisis-relevant products by encouraging sustainable production and supply chains and innovation in the Union and efficient use of medicinal products;<br>- strengthen the national health systems through improved health data use and re-use, development of digital tools and services, digital transformation of healthcare; enhancing access to healthcare; developing and implementing EU health legislation and evidence-based decision making; and integrated work among Member States\u2019 health systems.</p><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the Member States after cardiovascular disease. The prevention and control of cancer would benefit the majority of citizens since it shares common risk factors with other non-communicable diseases. Europe\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan, which is a key pillar of a stronger European Health Union, tackles the entire cancer disease pathway by means of flagship initiatives, such as launching a Cancer Inequalities Registry, and supporting actions, such as establishing an EU Network of Youth Cancer Survivors. The EU4Health programme will provide the financial support to implement these initiatives that are important to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer control and care.</p><p>Grants shall involve co-financing.
