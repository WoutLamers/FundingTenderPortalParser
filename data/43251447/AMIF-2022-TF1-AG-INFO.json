Preparatory analysis</u> in view of developing a tailored communication strategy for the project, in particular to identify the migration context, target audience(s) of the communication activities, its (their) characteristics, motivations, information needs and gaps as well as communication channels and tools, as to design the most effective approach to influence its (their) behaviour. The preparatory work should also rely as much as possible on results and lessons learnt from previous campaigns and communication activities carried out in the same country and should (if possible) use available primary and secondary data and own analysis. Where there is already available data that can be gathered from a thorough desk review, preparatory research should focus on field research on key unknowns, or on re-testing the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p><u>2. A tailored communication strategy</u> based on the outcome of the preparatory analysis, in particular to define:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li> <p>a comprehensive concept, including the overarching idea for the campaign structure, the key messages to be used throughout the period of implementation of the activities and the key visual elements;</p> </li><li> <p>a theory of change guiding both the campaign design and evaluation;</p> </li><li> <p>SMART campaign objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound);</p> </li><li> <p>the target audience and its segmentation (gender, age, education, profession, etc.);</p> </li><li> <p>the geographical scope of the campaign based on the target audience identified (which country/region and which part of that country in particular) and the specific migratory context (country of origin vs transit or destination);</p> </li><li> <p>the communication channels to be used depending on the target audience, ensuring a mix of traditional and social media, including media-buying plan where appropriate, as well as local or community level outreach, taking into account the habits of each segment of the target audience in terms of media access and consumption as well as the identification in the study on best practices of (remote) word-of-mouth messaging as the most effective and trusted communication channel in previous campaigns;</p> </li><li> <p>alternative communication tools where appropriate, such as theatre plays, community-led debates, contests (e.g. photo, song, video) and awards (e.g. for journalists), school visits, testimonials, involvement of celebrities etc., adapting them to the habits and characteristics of each context and segment of the target audience;</p> </li><li> <p>a creative approach allowing for participation and feedback from the target audience, e.g. by fostering use of smartphone apps and text messaging for both multiplication and monitoring/feedback purposes; a detailed plan for the roll-out and management of the campaign;</p> </li><li> <p>key performance indicators (KPIs), both qualitative and quantitative, with baseline and targets to be used to monitor the implementation and to assess the result of the campaign from the outset.</p> </li> </ul><p><u>3.
