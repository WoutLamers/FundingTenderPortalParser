Increasing awareness, protecting, strengthening resilience of individuals and in particular vulnerable groups (such as children, youth, etc\u2026) to polarisation.</p><p>2. Developing targeted exit programmes enabling radicalised individuals to deradicalise and disengage and rehabilitate based on an integrated multi-agency approach.</p><p>Projects must be aiming to achieve for the priority chosen one or more of the following outcomes:</p><p><u>1- Polarisation</u></p><p>- increasing awareness and capacity of first-line practitioners (e.g. police, teachers) to understand the dynamics, recognise and respond to the phenomena of polarisation at grass-roots level especially through awareness-raising and training activities;</p><p>- strengthening polarisation detection and response capacities through for example the setting up of mechanisms such as monitoring and polarisation management systems. This could enable to assess the causes and develop appropriate response to changes in community tensions and social unrests for the police and local authorities; </p><p>- promoting interaction and cooperation between different local actors from public sectors (law enforcement social services, etc) and NGOs that specialise in working with vulnerable groups and prevention of extremism as well as religious communities and other community-based organisations through the development of cooperation models; </p><p>- promoting the views of moderate voices, which are too often muted by more extreme voices through offline channels like organising debates and workshops, supported by online communication activities;</p><p>- developing and promoting concrete tools targeting vulnerable groups (e.g. <em>via</em> new media, application) on preventing polarisation.</p><p><u>2- Exit programmes</u></p><p>- setting up and facilitating the implementation of exit programmes building on existing programmes and offering practical assistance to individuals who want to deradicalise, disengage and rehabilitate within society. In particular, it could be done through local actors based on the development of methodological approaches and of quality and assessment criteria for interventions;</p><p>- setting up and facilitating the implementation of exit programmes that ensure continuity between interventions in the prison and probation context and further rehabilitation efforts into community in particular through local actors;</p><p>- setting up and facilitating the implementation of approaches that sow doubt in the mind of those individuals still not convinced to leave extremist groups and can lead to participation in exit programmes taking into account in the programmes, the ideology dimension (far, left wing, jihadism) but also practical and social living conditions of the individual in an integrated multi-agency approach.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.
