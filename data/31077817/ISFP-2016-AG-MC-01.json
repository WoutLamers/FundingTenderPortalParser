This fact constitutes a challenge for the law enforcement authorities that treat numerous cases as separate incidents. The challenge is to connect those individual incidents in order to reveal the organised nature of the phenomenon and tackle it efficiently. It is equally difficult to set efficient cross-border cooperation between various Member States in e.g. property crime cases not considered generally as &lsquo;serious criminality&rsquo;. In order to assess the real impact of this type of criminality, the negative impact on business and society of the high volume of individual incidents often linked to infrastructure and generating the sense of insecurity has to be considered.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the initial priorities of the Policy Cycle on Serious and Organised Crime set in 2011 was Mobile Organised Crime Groups changed later into Organised Property Crime (the latter addressing also the aspect of mobility of organised criminal groups). At the same time the Council Conclusions on setting the priorities for the fight against serious and organised crime between 2014 and 2017 encourage Member States to focus on particular types of networks, including outlaw motorcycle gangs in all of the EMPACT (European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats) priorities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The objective of the Call for Proposals is to address the raising poly-criminal nature of activities of organised crime groups and their increased mobility. Projects to be financed under this Call for Proposals shall be aiming at filling the operational gap in the cross-border cooperation and creating synergies between various criminal markets in relation to the mobile nature of criminal groups.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 6, 2016 3:06:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 6, 2016 3:06:03 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ISFP-2016-AG-MC-01(ISFP-AG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
