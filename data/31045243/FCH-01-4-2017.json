Regulations for indoor operations of vehicles and emission regulations for environmental zones in cities generate an increasing demand for zero emission drives for industrial mobile applications.</p><p>Promotion of both European based technology and commercialisation of hydrogen and fuel cells for industrial mobile applications are urgently required. Demonstrations MH vehicles fleets applying the latest fuel cell technologies should on one hand prove performance and reliability inducing customer acceptance and on the other hand enable cost reductions in fuel cell system and hydrogen infrastructure.</p><p>This demonstration project further aims, on one hand, to deploy, promote and benchmark the EU MH and industrial vehicle FC technology and value chain and on the other hand to evaluate the European market.</p><p>The topic is not intended to cover basic R&amp;D on new FC systems. Demonstration shall comprise 400 or more fuel cell MH and industrial vehicle units across multiple vehicle-user sites and applications aimed at proving a commercial customer value proposition. Demonstration should include necessary and relevant support of small-scale and low-cost hydrogen supply infrastructure designed for 35 MPa and the hydrogen generated should be from renewable energy.</p><p>Proposals should include installations with typical fleet sizes of 10 to 30 MHVs per site which represents the majority of installations in the EU and in at least 6 sites. However large fleets with 100+ MHVs in one site can also be considered.</p><p>This demonstration project therefore aims, on one hand, to deploy, promote and benchmark the EU MH and industrial vehicle FC technology and value chain and on the other hand to evaluate the European market (in at least 6 different sites).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The project must cover the deployment and evaluation of an European FC system technology by vehicle-users in real operating environments of a series of at least 400 MHVs and industrial vehicles and the related infrastructure.
