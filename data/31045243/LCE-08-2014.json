For local storage applications, addressed in this topic, it is desirable to include the interaction between the electricity grid and other energy uses such as the district heating/cooling network, CHP, micro-generation, local renewables and to include the most advanced ICT for optimising the whole system. Seen the various barriers that energy storage is facing, the activities under this topic should include the anticipation of potential market and regulatory issues with due consideration to the social, socioeconomic aspects and improved models to demonstrate energy storage systems. </p><p><i><u>Scope:</u></i> Activities should focus on integrating solutions that reached already TRL 5 to TRL 6 and above (please see part G of the General Annexes). </p><p>The direct/indirect storage must take into account grid interfaces and synergies between electricity, heating/cooling and final applications when they enable a clear benefit to be validated in this context. When appropriate, synergies between technologies could be used. The direct/indirect storage must take into account of grid interfaces and synergies between electricity, heating/cooling and final applications when they enable a clear benefit to be validated in this context.
