European industrial base, an essential building block of the EU's growth and competitiveness. In order to secure the sustainable access to primary and secondary raw materials, including metals, industrial minerals, construction raw materials, wood, and particularly Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) for the EU economy, there is a need to tackle a number of specific non-technology challenges at local, regional, national EU and global levels, as well as gaps in the knowledge on raw materials to foster the supply from the EU sources.</p><p>While the challenge to secure the raw materials supply is of a global nature, the actions to respond to the challenge are usually implemented at regional and local levels. There is a need to identify and bring together the EU regions with raw materials production capacity and common Smart specialisation objectives to exploit synergies, gain the trust of citizens and jointly improve the framework conditions, availability and performance of the industry, social aspects, stimulate investment and exchange of knowledge, foster innovation and competitiveness of industries in the raw materials value chains etc.</p><p>Specifically, the supply of CRMs to EU is at risk as they are often mined as by-products and still have global recycling rates below 1% after decades of use. There is a need for an expert group covering all the CRMs and as much as possible of their value chains, which would be able to comprehensively map CRM sources, provide recommendations for sourcing and better use of CRMs, including improving the European standards for efficient treatment of WEEE and waste batteries and other end-of-life products, while building on the experience and knowledge of existing specific groups, such as ERECON<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> and CRM-Innonet.</p><p>One of the major challenges regarding the EU knowledge base on primary and secondary mineral raw materials is the quality, harmonisation of the collected data and information sharing at the different levels within the EU. There is a need to optimise collection of data in Member States in support of the EU Knowledge Base on Raw Materials (EC Raw Materials Information System \u2013 RMIS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>)..</p><p>A specific challenge for the primary raw materials sector is an access to land within the land-use planning in parity with other activities. Most of the EU is densely populated and there are therefore conflicts of land-use caused by the competing interests of different activities and interest with economic requirements such as urbanization, nature conservation, agriculture, infrastructure etc.</p><p>For the secondary raw materials sector a proper collection of waste is a pre-condition for optimal recovery of materials from waste, which varies across the EU, Member States and their local governments who apply many different waste collection systems from co-mingled collection systems to separate collection. Decision-makers need more information about the overall performance of different systems, including their economic performance, and a better understanding of the conditions that are necessary for shifting to alternative, better-performing waste collection systems.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Projects should include a work-package to cluster with other projects financed under this topic and \u2013 if possible \u2013 with other relevant projects in the field funded by Horizon 2020, in support of the EIP on Raw Materials.</p><p>Proposals shall address <strong>only one</strong> of the following issues:</p><p><strong>a) Expert network on Critical Raw Materials (2016)</strong>: The proposed action should develop primarily an EU expert network or structure of networks covering all CRMs and where possible, include the stakeholders covering as much of the value chains as possible. <sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup> In case the new list will not be available at the deadline of the call, proposals should demonstrate the flexibility of incorporating new CRMs in the scope of the project. Proposals should build on the experience and knowledge gained from similar initiatives such as the ERECON <sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> a network on Rare Earth Elements, and CRM_InnoNet.</p><p>In order to support decision making of the producers and users of raw materials and the policy makers the projects should cover all the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>map, comprehensively assess and quantify estimated amounts of existing primary and secondary sources of and alternatives to the different CRMs;</li>  <li>estimate the expected EU demand of various CRMs in the future and identify major trends;</li>  <li>provide policy and technology recommendations for actions improving the production of the various primary and secondary CRMs and actions for their potential substitution, in order to secure their supply and decrease the relative dependence upon their imports;</li>  <li>provide a plan for transparent consultation with relevant external stakeholders and effective communication of the findings to the professional and general public across the EU;</li>  <li>In the case of secondary CRMs, the mapping information on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and waste batteries and other relevant end-of-life products within the EU is crucial, as well as the need to contribute to the further development of European standards for the treatment of WEEE in order to optimise the recovery of CRMs, identifying the most relevant WEEE categories and additional standardisation needs for the further development of CENELEC standards under the European Commission Mandate M/518 EN.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Up to <u>one</u> action for this topic part shall be funded.</p><p><strong>b) Good practice in waste collection systems (2017):</strong> Proposals should cover all the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>map and assess existing waste collection systems in a representative set of EU Member States for a wide range of waste streams, including packaging and paper waste, and end-of-life products (e.g. electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, transport vehicles, tyres, construction products, furniture);</li>  <li>where feasible assess advantages and disadvantages of different approaches \u2013 including environmental and socio-economic impacts \u2013 with quantified costs and benefits;</li>  <li>identify good practices and key elements for effective and efficient waste collection systems, as well as the barriers for implementation and possible solutions to overcome bottlenecks taking into consideration the adaptability of solutions to different regions of the EU;</li>  <li>validate the identified key elements, good practices, and the measures to overcome obstacles by consulting stakeholders through a participatory approach involving citizens and plan targeted dissemination actions.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that for this sub-topic, proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Up to <u>one</u> action for this topic part shall be funded.</p><p><strong>c) Optimising collection of raw materials data in Member States (2017):</strong> Proposals should cover all the following points:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>map and analyse the current situation of collection of data and data sources in all Member States;</li>  <li>provide recommendations for improvement of data sets and for EU level harmonization with justified benefits for the EU and the Member States and taking into account the INSPIRE Directive in order to enhance data availability and quality in the Raw Materials Information System (RMIS) <sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>;</li>  <li>demonstrate the applicability of recommendations on a number of improved data sets at Member States level. Improved data sets related to primary mineral raw materials should include for example: data on mineral occurrences and deposits; economic and technical data on mineral exploration and extraction; data on the environmental and social dimensions of extraction and, minerals intelligence data. Data sets related to secondary mineral raw materials should build on raw materials flows at Member state level (Materials Systems Analysis) and be presented in a form of Sankey diagrams.

This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nWithin this systemic approach, the Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' will focus on research and innovation which unlocks private and public investment in future solutions for a resource efficient, climate smart economy with a sustainable supply of raw materials. There is a consistent need to demonstrate Europe's potential for systemic innovation and market uptake of technological and non-technological solutions through large-scale demonstration projects. A transformative agenda on this scale requires major changes in attitudes and behaviour patterns and the contribution of social sciences and humanities will be essential to inform successful solutions. Complementary research and innovation activities are organised around the demonstration projects. Societal Challenge &lsquo;Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials&rsquo; will act as trailblazer for ensuring that the investment of 35% for climate action and 60% for sustainable development across the whole Horizon 2020 Framework Programme will deliver maximum impact for economic, environmental and social sustainability.<br />\r\nThis systemic approach is in line with Horizon 2020's Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) cross-cutting objective, engaging society, integrating the gender and ethical dimensions and ensuring access to research outcomes. The ethical dimension of the activities, including relevant socioeconomic implications, should be taken into account, such as personal data protection and privacy, protection of participants and researchers, ensuring informed consent, dual use and potential misuse of the research results, fair benefit sharing when developing countries are involved, animal welfare, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Given the transnational, global nature of climate change and the environment, and their scale and complexity, as well as of the raw materials supply chain, activities cover both EU level and beyond, thus contributing to the Commission's priority &lsquo;A Stronger Global Actor&rsquo;. International co-operation aims to boost the effectiveness of the actions promoted, within a scale-and-scope approach, e.g. GEO and the IPCC. Third countries, regions and international partners or programmes have been selected in order to maximise the impact and accelerate progress, e.g. the Belmont Forum. With regard to the broader international sustainability and climate change agenda, activities funded under Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' are expected to have an impact on the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, as well as on that of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015 (The Paris Agreement is subject to ratification of Parties).</p>\r\n<p>The cross-cutting nature of the issues addressed by this Societal Challenge results in a number of research and innovation areas which can most effectively be developed jointly with other Horizon 2020 parts (Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and other Societal Challenges), and in complementarity with other programmes e.g. LIFE, the Natural Capital Financing Facility (NCFF) under the LIFE programme, or the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Coherence and synergy with actions at national, regional or local levels, via the ESIF and links to EU Presidencies, and with other initiatives such as Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs) and the European Institute for Innovation and Technology&rsquo;s (EIT) Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), is also reinforced.<br />\r\nIn addition to the call H2020-SC5-2016-2017 'Greening the economy', activities relating to climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials are also found in the calls:<br />\r\nH2020-IND-CE-2016/17 'Industry 2020 in the Circular Economy&rsquo; (on eco-innovation),<br />\r\nH2020-SCC-2016/17 'Smart and Sustainable Cities' (on sustainable cities through nature-based solutions),<br />\r\nH2020-BG-2016-2017 &lsquo;Blue growth &ndash; demonstrating an ocean of opportunities' (on the Arctic),<br />\r\nH2020-SFS-2016-2017 &lsquo;Sustainable Food Security &ndash; Resilient and resource-efficient value chains&rsquo; (on Earth Observation for Africa),<br />\r\nH2020-LCE-2016-2017 'Competitive low-carbon energy' (on applied geo-sciences) and in the SME Instrument call H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Applicants can find additional information on the respective areas of the call in the text of the WP 2016-17.
