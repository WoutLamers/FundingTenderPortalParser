These challenges also create new opportunities for the development of operating methods that make it possible the increased participation of AUs through Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) Processes, including A-FLEX processes. The active involvement of AUs in this demonstration is needed for the evaluation in a live environment of these concepts and the quantification of their benefits.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Extended AMAN and TT management have been subject to research and development in the SESAR programme, with deployment-ready results published as solution packs (SESAR Solution 5, Extended Arrival Management Horizon, and SESAR solution 18, Calculated Takeoff Time (CTOT) and Target Time of Arrival (TTA)). The Extended AMAN, the AFLEX and the TT management concepts are subject to continuing current Industrial Research (IR) and Very Large Scale Demonstration (VLD) activities within the SESAR 2020 programme. This project will demonstrate the airspace user perspective of these concepts, and it must ensure that its activities are to be coordinated with parallel projects working in this area. In particular, this action follows on from the Project PJ25 XSTREAM funded under call H2020-SESAR-2015-2.</p><p>Consortia applying to this topic must include at least one AU, and they may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal. Participation of AUs with a variety of airframe/engine configurations so as to be representative of the fleet composition currently operating in Europe is considered as significant added value. Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project.</p><p>For the Extended AMAN trials there is no need for specific avionics equipment beyond what is currently required for operating in European airspace, and there will be no need for updating Airline Operations Centre (AOC) systems either. For the demonstration of the TT management and A-FLEX concepts, no avionics modifications are required, but AOC systems and processes may need to be updated.</p><p>AUs shall perform the demonstrations in collaboration with parallel demonstration projects dealing with the same subject to develop the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, participation in periodic follow-up meetings, production of all the documentation related to the demonstration as well as results dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.</p><p>Participating AUs will not need to dispatch any flights for the sole purpose of the demonstrations, i.e. participation shall always be through revenue flights. The demonstration flights shall land at the following major European Hubs: London Heathrow and Gatwick, Paris CDG/ORLY, or Zurich; their route must overfly one or more of the following ACCs: Maastricht, Reims, Paris, London, Karlsruhe, Brest, Shannon, Prestwick, Langen, Munich, Gen\u00e8ve, Marseille, or Bordeaux.</p><p>The consortium shall provide support to the ANSPs running the demonstrations in which they participate through this grant all along the demonstration lifecycle. This expected support includes collaboration for developing the concept of the demonstrations, participation in activities preparing the trials, periodic follow-up meetings and support for the production of all the documentation related to the demonstration, as well as participation in the demonstration dissemination and communication activities. Output from the demonstration shall include a report by each participating AU containing a full analysis of the impact of the procedures on AU performance.</p><p>The consortium shall provide to the ANSP running the demonstrations in which they participate relevant data from their demonstration flights for the operational evaluation of the performance of the concepts under demonstration. These data may include, among others, questionnaires or other feedback by airline staff (flight-crews and/or Airline Operations Centre (AOC) personnel), fuel burn data (potentially including suitably aggregated and de-identified FDR data), scheduling and punctuality data and descent efficiency data.</p><p>Applicants should note that all flights operating in the areas where SESAR extended AMAN demonstrations are taking place will need to comply with all instructions issued by ATC that originate from the extended AMAN concept (typically speed commands or lateral route revisions).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The demonstration will pave the way for implementing the E-AMAN as required in the PCP Regulation i.e. within an integrated global collaborative management of arrivals, including Airports, ACCs and Airlines, as well as for the implementation of the related advanced concepts AFLEX and advanced TT management. The objective is to reduce ATFCM and Arrival Sequencing and Metering Area (ASMA) delays in the TMA/E-TMA and also to increase flight efficiency. Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>EC IR (EU) No 716/2014</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.
