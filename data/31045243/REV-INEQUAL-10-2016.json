Children and young people are major users of the internet and online services, it needs to be ensured that they are equipped with the right and trusted environments to take advantage of this as active participants in the digital society. The online environment is rapidly changing and we need to develop the tools to identify and understand the needs of the young generation.</p><p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Y</a>oung people in Europe need not only the space to discuss and to engage with multiple stakeholders and decision makers across borders and boundaries, but also to be given the instruments to actively shape the research agenda as well as to participate in research related to their use of digital technologies. Innovative research methods are needed to empower children and young people by giving them an active role in research. Efforts need to be undertaken to give a voice and to empower children and young people who are marginalised or at risk of exclusion. Only an active participation of all citizens, and especially of all young people in shaping policy and broader societal developments, can create the basis for a well-functioning European society.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This coordination and support action should aim at the creation of an online platform to engage children and young people, framed by research according to their needs and behaviours. Children themselves will be able to take initiatives on the research topics and methods, while the researchers will act as facilitators. Children and young people will be given more active and participative roles that allow empowerment. The vulnerability of children and young people in the online environment and how to build online resilience will also play a role in this action. Gender issues will be paid particular attention. Furthermore, gender and diversity balance among the participating children and young people will be ensured.</p><p>The platform should bring together stakeholders from research and policy makers, together with children and young people around Europe. Synergies with the existing platforms such as the participation platform on the European Youth Portal should be envisaged. Specifically it should:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>allow for child and youth-directed research, where researchers and policy makers act as facilitators;</li>  <li>conduct research and develop a knowledge base as well as critical perspective on the use and interactions with the digital world of children and young people. This will be done in collaboration with interdisciplinary researchers and social scientists;</li>  <li>discuss within peers but also with decision makers, industry and civil society on their needs and expectations from the digital society;</li>  <li>co-create with multiple stakeholders research and policy priorities.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Stimulate children and young people's civic engagement through online participation;</li>  <li>Allow for innovative research methods on children's and young people's use of internet and digital technologies through their active participation in the research;</li>  <li>Empower children and young people by allowing them to take an active role in policy making and societal developments;</li>  <li>Leverage youth participation and dialogue with stakeholders and decision makers;</li>  <li>Ensure full and safe participation of children and young people in accessing and creating online content and services.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&amp;I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders.

Large disparities in human and social capacities are counterproductive to a sustainable and creative economy and participatory governance and inclusion. They jeopardise economic growth while threatening the very foundations of democracy, the rule of law and respect of human rights in Europe. These questions have to be analysed from a theoretical perspective and practical solutions to overcome inequalities have to be recommended.</p><p>For more inclusive societies to take shape in the medium term, coherent visions will need to be devised on how to foster a social and economic framework that promotes fairness and sustainability in Europe as key policy objectives, while enhancing social dialogue, respecting the continent\u2019s diversity and considering the global context.</p><p>The current migration crisis calls for a better European coordination of research on migration and asylum as well as a cross-national comparative research on migration. Two specific Platforms are envisaged in this call. In addition a research action on employability, skills, and labour market integration of migrants will provide new and policy relevant knowledge on this subject.</p><p>The rise in inequalities in Europe and other parts of the world comprises hitherto unknown quantitative and qualitative dimensions: in the wake of the financial and economic crisis, highly increased levels of inequality (e.g. income and wealth concentration, gender inequality) can be detected alongside novel types of inequalities (e.g. debt inequality, inequality in access to justice or political life, spatial inequality). Options to reverse inequalities should be evidence-based and suggested at EU level.</p><p>These recent trends will need to be fully understood and effectively tackled through comprehensive research and innovation activities. Based on a sound understanding of inequality trends, policies and measures aimed at reversing various kinds of inequalities need to be examined. Different options for policies and measures (e.g. social dialogue, tax policy, new forms of evidence-based education, public service innovation, welfare state reforms, labour market, employment and consumer policies and practices) should be identified and their usefulness be compared. Specific emphasis should be given to the objective of reversing territorial inequalities, equal enjoyment of human rights and the conditions enabling comprehensive urban policies, the mobile provision of social services and an equal access to ICT use.</p><p>Most of the Topics of REV-INEQUAL concern primarily the EU, although a certain number of issues clearly have an international dimension. This is particularly the case for Topic 2 on radicalisation, Topic 4 on mobility, and Topics 11, 12 and 13 on migration. The content of these Topics is linked with the ENG-GLOBALLY call (Topics 1, 3 and 10) and with the Societal Challenge 7 Topic SEC-06-FCT-2016: \u201c<em>Developing a comprehensive approach to violent radicalization in the EU from early understanding to improving protection</em>\u201d. In these Topics the participation of entities from the international partner countries and regions concerned is strongly encouraged.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: REV-INEQUAL-09-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-12-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-13-2017(RIA), REV-INEQUAL-11-2017(CSA)</p>\r\n<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-REV-INEQUAL-2016-2017<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Thursday 2 of February 17 Pm 2017.
