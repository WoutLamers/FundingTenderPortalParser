In the past years, there have been significant efforts in research to develop the technologies for vehicles and infrastructure to enable automated driving functions. However, substantial challenges remain on the path to a European wide deployment. There is a great need to demonstrate the technological readiness, reliability and safety of the automated driving functions in a large scale pilot at European scale. Before the market introduction, it is important to test automated cars in mixed traffic situations, analyse the interaction between the driver, the cars and the traffic environment, study the behaviour of other traffic participants and get an insight into automated driving under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.). In addition these pilots should assess the viability of different business models to ensure investments are done by those benefiting the most. For implementing large scale testing, Member States may need to adapt their regulatory framework and solve liability issues in case of accidents with automated vehicles.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The action will integrate and test enabling technologies for automation level 3 (Conditional Automation) and evaluate the benefits in Field Operational Tests (FOTs) for passenger cars. Possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation) can also be tested, although the focus of the FOT should be on technologies for automation level 3. This needs the active involvement of all stakeholders such as car manufacturers, automotive suppliers, road users, insurance companies, road and traffic authorities, the EU Member States, etc., because the responsibility and liability of all stakeholders relating to the testing, demonstrating and use of automated cars requires clarification before market introduction. The FOTs should take place in at least 3 different countries. Automation pilots for all driving situations (i.e. from highway to urban) are within scope. If proposals include FOTs on highways, testing across borders should be considered. Consortia should commit to make the data collected during the pilots available through common data sharing frameworks in order to foster further research.</p><p>The automation pilots should consider all the following aspects:</p><p>\u2015Demonstrate the robustness and reliability (functional safety) of technologies, systems and functions needed to support the gradual progress towards full automation, in particular from level 2 \u2013 Partial Automation (human driver monitors the driving environment) to level 3 (Conditional Automation) including possible additional functions towards level 4 (High Automation).</p><p>\u2015Evaluate effects of automated driving systems (e.g. on traffic flow, communication, etc.) in a mixed traffic environment with automated and non-automated vehicles and under different conditions (e.g. traffic intensity, weather, lighting, etc.).</p><p>\u2015Analyse user acceptance and behaviour; study interaction between the driver, the vehicles and the traffic environment and behaviour of other traffic participants.</p><p>\u2015Focus on the in-vehicle evaluation of the driver under real traffic conditions in particular during the transition of control from the vehicle system to the driver and vice versa, e.g. expectations, adoption, acceptance, trust, usability driver position; human-vehicle interaction, monitoring strategies; investigate intended and unintended use of the system and possible mitigation solutions; evaluate fail operational solutions (e.g. emergency stop). Gender balanced representation of the reference group should be ensured and data analysed in a disaggregated way.</p><p>\u2015Conduct impact assessment (e.g. safety, energy use, pollutant emissions, traffic congestion, mobility behaviour, social inclusion, use of transport services, etc.) on real world data sets.</p><p>\u2015Establish a pan-European common catalogue on necessary characteristics of cooperative decision, planning and control algorithms, including self-adaptation and learning features and ethical questions.</p><p>\u2015Fulfil all security requirements to protect the system to any threats and avoid any conscious manipulations of the information enabling automated driving systems.</p><p>Proposed actions may consider C-ITS communication and European GNSS as a possibility to improve the safety and reliability of automated transport systems in the future.</p><p>The size of proposals will depend on the geographical coverage of the large scale demonstrations.</p><p>Consideration should be taken of gender aspects and other demographic factors such as ageing, etc.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 18 to 36 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Actions are expected to demonstrate the technological readiness, reliability and safety of the automated driving functions in a large scale pilot at European scale. They will test automated vehicles at automation level 3 (including possible additional functions towards automation level 4) in mixed traffic situations. Actions are expected to demonstrate that automated driving systems for passenger vehicles can contribute to increase road safety and transport efficiency, reduce energy use, pollutant emissions and traffic congestions, and therefore support climate action and sustainable development objectives. This action will provide significant contributions in the following areas:</p><p>\u2015User acceptance and the interaction between the driver, the vehicles and the traffic environment (including other road users) in different real traffic conditions.</p><p>\u2015Wider socio-economic impacts of automated driving and the benefits for the driver in terms of mobility, comfort, convenience and safety and analyse specific issues related to gender and other demographic factors such as ageing, etc.</p><p>\u2015Uptake of new automated transport business models.</p><p>\u2015Benefits resulting from the interaction between automated driving technologies and V2X communication (connected driving).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_australia_en.pdf\" class=\"ext\" rel=\"external\">Australia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_brazil_en.pdf\" class=\"ext\" rel=\"external\">Brazil</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_canada_en.pdf\" class=\"ext\" rel=\"external\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\" class=\"ext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">China</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_hong_kong_en.pdf\" class=\"ext\" rel=\"external\">Hong Kong &amp;

Automakers around the world are unanimous in predicting the emergence of systems for automated driving sometime in the near future.</p><p>Current technology will evolve further towards semi-automation and eventually towards full automation in real moving traffic. This evolution is very promising and may help to drastically reduce road fatalities to near zero, as more than 90% of road accidents are partly or fully due to human errors. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges related to technology, digital infrastructure, user and societal acceptance, driver behaviour, regulation and legislation, and business models, which need to be tackled to enable the deployment of automated driving on European roads.</p><p>The main contribution of this call will be to support the short term introduction of passenger cars automated driving level 3 (Conditional Automation - Full driving performed by an automated driving system with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene in real traffic conditions)[[The SAE International's standard J3016 identifies six levels of driving automation from \"no automation\" to \"full automation\"]] including safe stops, and of truck platooning in real traffic conditions from 2020 onwards. The main focus of this call is on demonstrations of automated driving systems for passenger cars, trucks and urban transport. Demonstrations will be complemented by further research on digital infrastructure to ensure the necessary level of safety, reliability and efficiency of automated driving systems and by a comprehensive analysis of safety aspects in relation to mixed traffic conditions and their influence on end user acceptance. This call includes also an action to assess road infrastructure requirements for higher levels of vehicle automation and to coordinate and support all research and innovation activities on automated driving both at European and international levels.</p><p>Cooperative systems and connectivity, based on communication of real-time vehicle data, as important means to increase the performance of automated driving will also be addressed in other calls, such as Mobility for Growth (topic MG-6.2-2016 on 'Large-scale demonstration(s) of cooperative ITS'). There is considerable complementarity between the development and deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems and that of Automated Road Transport. ICT components e.g. sensors and microsystems and data fusion which are important elements of automated road transport will be addressed in the LEIT/ICT Work Programme, as well as in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. The 'Internet of Things' call [Work Programme Part Cross-cutting activities (Focus Areas) \u2013 Annex 20] addresses a pilot on 'Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment' which focuses on technology research in a broader IoT context, including horizontal elements such as ethics and privacy, trust and security, validation, standards and interoperability, user acceptability and human factor, liability and sustainability. There is also complementarity with the LEIT/Space Work Programme part, in particular with the call 'Applications in Satellite Navigation \u2013 Galileo', topic 'Galileo-1-2017 \u2013 EGNSS Transport'.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "content": "<p>On 27 September 2017 a total of 7 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2017 two-stage topics (Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the Generalised Feedback for the first stage of 2017 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "content": "<p><br />\r\nOn 26 January 2017 a total of 22 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;14 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;6 proposals</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "content": "<p>On 29 September 2016 a total of 11 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nART-02-2016 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-04-2016 &ndash; 4 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 &ndash; 6 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-07-2017(IA), ART-01-2017(IA), ART-03-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2016 two-stage topics <strong>(Flash Call Info)</strong> can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the <strong>Generalised Feedback</strong> for the first stage of 2016 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Previous updates:</strong></p>\r\n<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "content": "<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-04-2016(RIA), ART-05-2016(RIA), ART-02-2016(IA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
