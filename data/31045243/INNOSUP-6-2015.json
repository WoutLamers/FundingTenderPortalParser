Innovation support services are addressing this challenge traditionally by two interventions that are often combined: (a) the provision of networking space for personal meetings either as one-off meeting (\u2018brokerage events\u2019) or as more stable networks (\u2018clusters\u2019) often with a limited geographic reach; and (b) the definition of \u2018cooperation profiles\u2019 (\u2018technology offers\u2019, \u2018partner search profile\u2019 etc.) that are distributed through networks of intermediaries. To a different degree intermediaries become active in establishing the partnership (\u2018brokerage\u2019). Social media and other web-based services challenge these existing approaches and ask for their revision.</p><p>The British \u2018connect\u2019 platform is the first publicly financed innovation platform on the web that creates a protected space for companies to display their competences, interest and skills, to reach out to a large number of peers, to make them personal contacts and to engage them in initial cooperation. Commercial offers like \u2018linked in\u2019 or various crowdsourcing platforms offer important elements while not regarding themselves as innovation platforms for SMEs.</p><p>However, it becomes evident that only a small number of enterprises using the platform have already the skills to draw full benefits from the opportunities. Most establish contacts on the platform \u2013 which effectively eliminates the \u2018brokerage function\u2019 that is so far provided by many intermediaries \u2013 but are unable to maintain the group of contacts or to draw on their skills in the preparation of innovation projects. In that respect they could benefit from a new generation of support services that assist to create value from online collaboration with a group of contacts and potential partners (\u201cassistance to online collaboration for innovation\u201d)\u00a0 </p><p>So far staff in innovation agencies has hardly skills to assist their clients to establish collaborations on web platforms and no profile of skills has been defined. Commercial offers by crowdsourcing platforms remain effectively unaffordable for SMEs or face difficulties to scale up their offers and reach a critical mass of the community. </p><p><u>Scope:</u> To address the described gaps proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:</p><ul>  <li>develop and test new service designs for \u2018assistance to online collaboration for innovation\u2019 for SMEs in diverse sectors;</li>  <li>make such new services accessible for enterprises in sectors that are typically not yet benefitting from innovation support; </li> </ul><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 develop and test a qualification profile, curriculum and training courses for staff currently providing brokerage services in established networks or SME agencies. </p><p>Service designs and qualification profiles shall be formulated independently from a particular collaboration or social media platform. Tests of services shall be undertaken on platforms that are open and bring together already a critical mass of enterprises and innovation stakeholders. Establishing such platforms will not be supported.</p><p>The nature of the topic \u2013 online collaboration \u2013 suggests that the training modules are established as web-based self- or collaborative learning modules that are supported by case studies in the form of videos. The qualification profiles and training modules shall be published under a creative commons license.</p><p>Projects proposing new service designs for \u2018assistance to online collaboration for innovation\u2019 should indicate on which platform(s) the new service would be tested and in how far the newly developed service could be scaled-up.</p><p>It is intended to support 2-3 projects from the indicative budget.</p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> \u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New services assisting online collaboration for innovation help SMEs to access a broader range of potential innovation partners and mobilise them in a timely manner for concrete projects.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The qualification profile and training material are made available to SME innovation support agencies interested in enhancing the skills of their staff. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The efficiency of innovation support service provision - for example but not limited to the services of Enterprise Europe Network \u2013 is enhanced. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Resources in public innovation support are reoriented from information and brokerage functions \u2013 which can to a large extend be automated \u2013 to higher value added functions like the identification of opportunities and the animation of project development.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Coordination and support action</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\">&nbsp;</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp; Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-h-esacrit_en.pdf\">part H of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"> [, with the following exceptions]: </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>For the evaluation of first-stage proposals under a two-stage submission procedure, only the criteria &lsquo;excellence&rsquo; and &lsquo;impact&rsquo; will be evaluated.
