Perhaps due to this diversity, and save a few specific cases, the European Union has lacked a strategic approach towards the region, despite strong economic interests and heightened security concerns in the area. Several EU Member States have adopted an active bilateral approach towards key partners, but the European Union has mostly failed to speak with one voice in relevant fora. Nowadays the multiple and complex challenges shared by the two regions, ranging from climate change and sustainable development to conventional and non-conventional security challenges, are opening up new opportunities for the EU to become more involved in the region beyond economic cooperation although differences remain in areas like human rights or democratic governance. In order to re-think its role and strategy for the Asia-Pacific, and to fully tap the potential for action at European level, the European Union needs to be supported by sound research showing the concrete implications of further engaging with and in the region in a number of sectorial and geographic areas.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The research to address this challenge should in particular focus on the following key dimensions. It is expected to either comprehensively address one of these dimensions or to combine them. The research may also cover other issues relevant for addressing the specific challenge.</p><p>1) Regional integration in South-East Asia and its consequences for Europe</p><p>South-East Asia has seen, since 1967, the most ambitious project of regional integration outside of Europe, pursued through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It has followed a different integration path to Europe, based on dialogue and non-interference rather than convergence and law. The region has an immense social, cultural and economic potential, but it still faces the challenge of developing a regional identity with both an internal dimension (how to nourish a sense of belonging) and an external dimension (how to engage with foreign powers, such as China, India, the United States, Japan and the EU). The process of nation-building in the ten ASEAN countries and other non-ASEAN countries is incomplete or nascent. It is also confronted with widespread poverty, disruptive migration flows, inter-ethnic conflicts and even territorial disputes. For the EU to engage effectively in South-East Asia and manage the variety of countries and cultures present in the region, it is necessary to understand what \u2018region\u2019 means to the peoples of these countries within and beyond the ASEAN context. Research is thus necessary on the mobility of people, knowledge, ideologies, cultures, goods and capital within the region and their influence on the emergence of a South-East Asian identity which would help the EU and its Member States to forge coherent, adapted and culturally relevant foreign policies with all countries in the region.</p><p>To that effect, research should also underpin the implementation of the Joint Communication on EU-ASEAN relations in the different sectors and in particular in the field of sectorial cooperation.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p><p>2) Governance in and of the Pacific as a challenge for Europe</p><p>One of the major strategic challenges in the Asia-Pacific region relates to the governance of the Pacific itself (including Overseas Countries and Territories). The Pacific Islands region represents a unique diversity of nation-state formations and regional and intergovernmental mechanisms, which is experiencing major challenges regarding the protection of its exceptional natural environment, threatened in particular by climate change. The small islands developing states (SIDS) of the Pacific therefore have a central role in the contestation over, competition for, and conservation of some of the world\u2019s key resources, far surpassing their modest size in terms of land mass and population. As the second largest donor of development assistance to the region, the EU\u2019s interests and activities in the Pacific are highly significant and hold important potential for the future. However, the region\u2019s new geopolitical currency is a willingness to seriously engage with emerging definitions of an equal, two-way partnership relation in Pacific terms that expands beyond the monetary dimension of cooperation. The EU is thus at a cross-road in its engagement with the Pacific. Research should examine the emerging governance structures in the region, in terms of sovereignty, state-making, policy autonomy and aid dependency, by paying close attention to issues such as trade and transport, fisheries management, climate change, biodiversity, social inclusion, democracy, blue/green growth and and political CFSP aspects. Research should also comparatively analyse the role and impact of external actors in the region, prominently focussing on the European Union and its Member States but also take account of the influence of, and the interplay with global (China, USA) and regional (Australia, New Zealand) powers in the region. Building on existing research, lessons should be drawn from the Pacific experience for devising new approaches, as well as on how Europe can effectively respond to the strategic challenge posed by the Pacific.</p><p>The participation of partners from third countries and regions in the targeted geographic areas in proposals submitted to this topic is strongly encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million for each dimension would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Research under this topic is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the strategic challenges that Europe faces in the various zones of the Asia-Pacific region, and on a range of relevant subjects. Based on this, it will inform different foreign policy actors, processes and initiatives at EU and Member State-level either with a sectorial or geographic focus, especially by providing essential insights on the legal, cultural and socio-economic aspects surrounding their implementation.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a> JOIN(2015)22 Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the Council - The EU and ASEAN: a partnership with a strategic purpose.</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

Recent developments show just how dynamically the strategic and geopolitical contexts are changing. These developments represent intricate challenges but also opportunities for Europe to develop and vary its analysis and build more robust anticipative, proactive and reactive capacities.</p><p>In such turbulent times, greater emphasis should be placed on fostering new types of actions that allow for engaging together globally, which strengthen the position of Europe on the global scene, including by improving the coordination between EU Member States and broadening its means of external action.</p><p>To better anticipate and address challenges in key regions, it is essential to maximise the EU\u2019s clout in global affairs. Research activities will look into the best means of ensuring synergies and consistency between Member States, EU foreign policy goals and instruments. Maximising its clout also presupposes understanding Europe in a global context and its historical and cultural legacy.</p><p>It is also imperative to implement the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation by strengthening activities to promote the position of Europe on the global scene, attract international partners to Horizon 2020, enhance research and innovation exchanges and dialogue, and strengthen the European R&amp;I presence in strategic partner countries and regions.</p><p>In Work Programme 2014-2015 topics focused on issues in the immediate EU neighbourhood regions (both South and East), as well as joint challenges with strategic partners such as cultural, scientific and social relations with Latin America.</p><p>In complement, this Work Programme presents Topics 1 and 2 on challenges of geopolitical shocks and radicalisation that appear in cross-cutting way in several Topics and Calls of SC6[[Topics REV-INEQUAL-02-2016 and REV-INEQUAL-04-2016 address radicalisation and migration trends within Europe.]] and SC7, as well as integration and science diplomacy. Proposals to this set of topics are encouraged to address issues across these challenges.</p><p>Topic 4 targets the use of scientific knowledge on the EU's neighbouring countries and regions for EU policy-making. Topic 5 investigates EU external trade strategies and their inter-linkages, coherence and effectiveness vis-\u00e0-vis other external policies.</p><p>Topics 6, 7 and 8 broaden the geographical coverage of the first Work Programme focusing on Asia-Pacific, Central Asia, and China specifically.</p><p>Topic 9 addresses the challenge of strengthening the position of Europe as a global actor by reinforcing the presence of European research and innovation actors in selected international partner countries and regions.</p><p>Topics 3 and 10 deal with migration and asylum systems.</p><p>In all Topics the participation of entities from the international partner countries and regions concerned is strongly encouraged.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 8, 2017 7:02:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 8, 2017 7:02:03 PM", "content": "<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-ENG-GLOBALLY-2016-2017</p>\r\n<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available&nbsp; under the &lsquo;Topic conditions &amp; documents&rsquo; section on the topic page of the following topics:</p>\r\n<p>ENG-GLOBALLY-1:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-2:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-3:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-5:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-6:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-10:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-8: RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-4: CSA <br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-7: CSA</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe submission session is now available for: ENG-GLOBALLY-02-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-07-2017(CSA), ENG-GLOBALLY-04-2017(CSA), ENG-GLOBALLY-03-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-06-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-01-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-05-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-08-2016-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-10-2017(RIA)</p>\r\n<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-ENG-GLOBALLY-2016-2017<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Thursday 2 of February 17 Pm 2017.
