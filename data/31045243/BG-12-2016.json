This must take into consideration the proper functioning of vulnerable marine ecosystems and sea-related economic sectors. In the Mediterranean region, several issues are specifically acute such as the vulnerability and poor resilience of ecosystems, the over-exploitation of seabed and biological resources, the severe pollution events and limited remediation actions, the drastic climate change effects, the frequent extreme events and geohazards, and the uneven protection of coastal infrastructures and populations. The EU is committed to supporting the development of solutions to solve the above mentioned issues through several policies and international agreements such as the EU Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP), the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the EU neighbourhood policy, the Barcelona convention and more recently the EU BLUEMED Initiative<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>. One of the main goals of the latter is to create an interoperable, fully integrated multiplatform observing and forecasting capacity to support the conservation of biodiversity, and to forecast and manage risks and emergencies at the coast and at sea. The implementation of these policies and conventions requires a strong knowledge base and predictive capacities that are derived from Earth observation data. These observation data are, however, still very fragmented, or are even lacking for certain areas of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular in the southern part. They are also still difficult to access, partly because of the many initiatives and systems that exist. The challenge here is to conduct the research and innovation activities that are necessary for the integration of the existing Earth observation facilities and networks in the Mediterranean Sea building on relevant initiatives such as Copernicus<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, GEOSS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, GOOS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, EMODNet<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, ESFRI<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> and in particular all those with strong links to marine and maritime issues, and national initiatives. This would fill out the existing observational gaps, and would help exploit the relevant data to build the necessary knowledge base and prediction capacities.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The research and innovation activities to be included in the proposal should contribute to the development of an integrated observing system for the whole Mediterranean Sea building on existing facilities (remote sensing and<em> in-situ</em>) and initiatives, and addressing both the open sea and the coastal zone. This should be based on open data and should facilitate easy access to those facilities and the data. Another focus should be on conducting the research and innovation necessary to underpin the full and open discovery and access to the ocean observations and to facilitate the interoperable exchange of ocean observation as promoted through the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) for the Mediterranean Sea. The proposal should also address observational gaps in the Mediterranean Sea, in particular those related to the <em>in-situ</em> component of the observation system. Optimising existing systems and using new ocean observation technologies make <em>in-situ</em> ocean observation and the integration of the biological dimension into observing systems more cost-effective. The proposals should also focus on the use of <em>in-situ</em> measurements to calibrate and validate relevant remote sensing data and products, including possible new products derived from space infrastructures such as the Sentinel and Earth Explorer missions that support the improvement and evolution of operational services in the Mediterranean Sea. The above activities should include the participation of international partners from the coastal states of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>In line with the objective of the EU Strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation (COM (2012) 497), proposals should contribute to implementing the Research and Innovation Initiative for Blue Jobs and Growth in the Mediterranean Area (The BLUEMED Initiative)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 8 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will by default participate in the Pilot on Open Research Data in Horizon 2020, with the option to opt-out, as described in the introduction.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>To contribute to the implementation of the BLUEMED Initiative's vision and its related Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda and Implementation Plan, in particular as regards the goal to develop an integrated Mediterranean observing system, proposals must:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Provide an additional European contribution to established global observing systems e.g. Copernicus and GEOSS.

This topic participates per default in the open access to research data pilot which aims to improve and maximise access to and re-use of research data generated by projects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The pilot applies to the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications. Additionally, projects can choose to make other data available for open access and need to describe their approach in a Data Management Plan (to be provided within six months after the project start).</li>\r\n    <li>Note that the evaluation phase proposals will not be evaluated more favourably because they are part of the Pilot, and will not be penalised for opting out of the Pilot.</li>\r\n    <li>Projects can at any stage opt-out of the pilot.</li>\r\n    <li>The legal requirements for projects participating in this pilot are in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf#page=66\">article 29.3 of the Model Grant Agreement</a></li>\r\n    <li>Further information on the Open Research Data Pilot is made available in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/open-access-dissemination_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>8.
