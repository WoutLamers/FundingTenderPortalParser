However, inclusion in the ESFRI roadmap does not guarantee that these needed infrastructures will be built. Before proceeding with the construction and/or implementation of the identified infrastructures, many preliminary decisions need to be taken with respect to issues such as the identification of funders, the financial plan for sustainability, the governance by involved stakeholders, the site and legal form of the managing organisation (and of the research infrastructure, if different), the architecture and the service policies. The aim of this activity is to provide catalytic and leveraging support for the preparatory phase and the early phase of ESFRI projects leading to the construction of new research infrastructures or major upgrades of existing ones.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Following the update of the ESFRI Roadmap in 2016, support under this work programme will be provided to:</p><p><strong><em>(a) Preparatory Phase </em></strong>for research infrastructures which enter the active project list of the ESFRI roadmap in 2016 (<strong><em>Coordination and Support actions)</em></strong></p><p>The preparatory phase aims to bring the project for the new or upgraded research infrastructure identified in the ESFRI roadmap to the level of legal, financial, and, where applicable, technical maturity required for implementing it.</p><p>Proposal consortia should involve all the stakeholders necessary to move the project forward, to take the decisions, and to make the financial commitments, before construction can start (e.g. national/regional ministries/governments, research councils, funding agencies, in particular, but not limited to, from the countries that have already declared their commitment in the application to ESFRI). Appropriate contacts with ministries and decision-makers should be continuously reinforced, thus further strengthening the consortia. Operators of research facilities, research centres, universities, and industry may also be involved whenever appropriate. Technical work should be carried out when necessary to complete the final technical design, providing a sound technical base for establishing a cost baseline and detailed financial planning. The financial needs of the project should be mapped out to the extent necessary for funding agencies to establish their own medium- and long-term financial planning.</p><p>The preparation of the legal and financial agreements (including site, governance, internal rules, financing of the new research infrastructures) is one of the main activities and deliverables and should be finalised before the end of the project (e.g., through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding).</p><p>The detailed list of activities that can be included in a preparatory phase proposal is given in part A of the section \u201cSpecific features for Research Infrastructures\u201d. Proposals should explain any synergies and complementarities with previous or current EU grants.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 4 million would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</em></p><p><strong><em>(b) Support to Early Phase </em></strong>for research infrastructures which enter the ESFRI roadmap in 2016 as emerging projects (<strong><em>Research and Innovation Actions) </em></strong></p><p>This support aims to bring an emerging ESFRI project to the level of maturity required for being in the active project list.</p><p>To this extent activities will include the needed scientific, technical and conceptual work: e.g. the drafting of architecture and engineering plans for the construction, the creation of prototypes; plans to coherently integrate the new infrastructure into the European landscape of related facilities; the estimated budget for construction and operation; plans for an international governance structure; the planning of research services to be provided at international level, procedure and criteria to choose the site of the infrastructure.

Support will be provided to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>the conceptual and technical design of new research infrastructures, which are of a clear European dimension and interest, through a bottom-up approach (deadline and budget 2017);</li>  <li>the preparatory phases and the support to early phase of ESFRI projects, through a targeted approach (deadline and budget 2016);</li>  <li>the individual support to ESFRI and other world-class research infrastructures with established legal structure and governance such as an ERIC through a competitive approach (deadline 2016 and budget 2016-2017);</li>  <li>a pilot action addressing the federation, networking and coordination of pan-European research infrastructures and clouds for the purpose of increasing research and science data availability and use (deadline and budget 2016).</li> </ul><p>As indicated in the Model Grant Agreement (Article 6.2.D.4), the methodology for charging capitalised and operating costs of \"<em>large research infrastructures</em>\", defined in this same Article, is not applicable for grants awarded under this call.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 25, 2017 11:27:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 25, 2017 11:27:00 AM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) for the topic INFRADEV-01-2017 that closed on 29 March 2017 is now available under the &lsquo;Topic conditions &amp; documents&rsquo; section on the topic page.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 11, 2017 4:19:15 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 11, 2017 4:19:15 PM", "content": "<p>A total of&nbsp;39 proposals were submitted in response to this call&nbsp;(topic: INFRADEV-01-2017).</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INFRADEV-01-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 19, 2016 5:12:50 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 19, 2016 5:12:50 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) for the topics&nbsp;INFRADEV-02-2016 and INFRADEV-04-2016&nbsp;that closed on 22 June 2016 is now available under the &lsquo;Topic conditions &amp; documents&rsquo; section on the topic page.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 31, 2016 10:52:25 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 31, 2016 10:52:25 AM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) for the topic&nbsp;INFRADEV-03-2016-2017 that closed on 30 March 2016 is now available under the &lsquo;Topic conditions &amp; documents&rsquo; section on the topic page.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 10, 2016 5:45:06 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 10, 2016 5:45:06 PM", "content": "<p>A total of 12 proposals were submitted in response to this call.
