Complex primary and secondary resources contain many different raw materials. Their processing, reuse, recycling and recovery schemes are complex and imply different steps, ranging from collection, logistics, sorting and separation to cleaning, refining and purification of materials.</p><p>The challenge for industry is to scale up promising raw materials production technologies and to demonstrate that raw materials can be produced in an innovative and sustainable way in order to make sure that research and innovation end up on the market, to strengthen the competitiveness of the European raw materials industries, meet ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030, minimise environmental impacts and risks, and gain the trust of EU citizens in the raw materials sector.</p><p>This specific challenge addresses the development of \"innovative pilot actions\"<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>, which is one of the major targets of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative pilots for the clean and sustainable production of non-energy, non-agricultural raw materials in the EU from primary and/or secondary sources finishing at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 6-7.</p><p>All actions should contribute to achieving the targets of the EIP on Raw Materials, particularly in terms of innovative pilot actions on processing, refining and/or recycling for the innovative production of raw materials, and to building the EU knowledge base of primary and secondary raw materials by feeding into the EC Raw Materials Information System \u2013 RMIS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. Actions should also contribute to improving the awareness of relevant external stakeholders and the general public across the EU about the importance of raw materials for society, the challenges related to their supply within the EU and about proposed solutions which could help to improve society's acceptance of and trust in sustainable raw materials production in the EU, duly taking into account the applicable EU environmental legislation.</p><p>All actions should facilitate the market uptake of solutions developed through industrially- and user-driven multidisciplinary consortia covering the relevant value chain and should consider standardisation aspects when relevant.</p><p>All actions should justify the relevance of selected pilot demonstrations in different locations within the EU (and also outside if there is a clear added value for the EU economy, industry and society).</p><p>All actions should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, as outlined in the Introduction of this part of the Work Programme (with indicated CAPEX, OPEX, IRR and NPV<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>), with clarified management of intellectual property rights, and commitment to the first exploitation.</p><p>Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this cross-cutting call and other relevant projects supporting the EIP on Raw Materials is strongly encouraged..</p><p>In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation is encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 million and EUR 13 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>Applying a circular economy approach throughout the entire value chain, actions for this topic should address <u>only one</u> of the following sub-topics:</p><p><strong>a)</strong> <strong>Sustainable processing and refining of primary and/or secondary raw materials: </strong>Actions should demonstrate new or improved systems integrating relevant processing and refining technologies for better recovery of minerals and metals at increased efficiency in terms of better yield and process selectivity as well as better utilisation of resources (hence reducing wastes). This would include processing of and recovery from low grade and/or complex ores and/or from industrial or mining wastes or landfills, and/or the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials. The importance of the targeted raw materials and their sources for the EU should be demonstrated in the proposal. The solution proposed should be flexible enough to adapt to different or variable ore/secondary raw material grades and should be supported by efficient and robust process control. Where relevant, any solution proposed for the reduction of the content of toxic elements or compounds in the resulting materials should also include the appropriate management of the hazardous substances removed. Recycling of end-of-life products is excluded from this option.</p><p><strong>b) Recycling of raw materials from end-of-life products:</strong> Actions should develop and demonstrate novel and environmentally sound solutions for a higher recycling and recovery of secondary raw materials from end-of-life products such as waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), batteries, wood-based panels, multi-material paper packaging, end-of-life tyres, etc. These products can contain different minerals, metals, wood and wood-fibre, rubber, etc. (including critical raw materials and other technology metals).</p><p><strong>c) Recycling of raw materials from buildings and infrastructures:</strong> Actions should develop and demonstrate novel solutions for a high-value recovery of raw materials from buildings and infrastructures. Actions should also benchmark against a series of comparative case studies of construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW) management in deconstruction of buildings and infrastructure of representative size categories in countries with different types of end-of-life building and infrastructure stocks, showcasing the appropriate use of the following: the EU C&amp;DW Management Protocol<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, pre-demolition audit, smart demolition practices, using appropriate technical equipment, and sorting/processing and quality management of waste fractions such as metals, aggregates, concrete, bricks, plasterboard, glass, polymers and plastics and wood.</p><p><strong>d) Advanced sorting systems for high-performance recycling of complex end-of-life products:</strong> Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative dismantling and sorting systems enabling functional recycling of critical raw materials, or other types of highly efficient recovery of metals, minerals or construction materials, from complex end-of-life products and scrap thereof. The advanced sorting systems should achieve very high throughput rates in order to allow their economically viable operation on the European market.</p><p><strong>e) Sustainable metallurgical processes:</strong> Actions should develop and demonstrate innovative metallurgical systems integrating pyro-, hydro-, bio-, and/or electro-metallurgical and/or electrochemical technologies, in order to enhance the production efficiency in terms of increased yield and selectivity, higher grade and purity of the produced metals from primary and/or secondary raw materials as well as the environmental performance throughout the whole life cycle.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The project results are expected to contribute to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>pushing the EU to the forefront in the area of raw materials processing and/or recycling technologies and solutions through generated know-how (planned patents, publications in high impact journals and joint public-private publications etc.), and promoting socially innovative solutions;</li><li>improving significantly the economic viability and market potential that will be gained through the pilot, leading to expanding the business across the EU after the project is finished, as well as creating added value and new jobs in raw materials producing, equipment manufacturing and/or downstream industries;</li><li>unlocking a significant volume of various primary/secondary raw materials currently unexploited/underexploited within the EU, hence improving their 'circularity' in the economy and ultimately closing the material cycles for a circular economy;</li><li>improving significantly the health, safety and environmental performance throughout the whole life cycle considered, including better energy and water efficiency, a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants, a reduction in waste generation and wastewater and a better recovery of resources from generated waste or a better recovery and recycling of resources from complex end-of-life products;</li><li>additionally, only for sub-topic b) 'Recycling of raw materials from end-of-life products', in the shorter term, increasing measurably the efficiency and effectiveness (range, yield, quality and selectivity of recovered materials) of the exploitation of complex and heterogeneous secondary raw materials deposits ('urban mines') when compared to the state of the art;</li><li>additionally, only for sub-topic c) 'Recycling of raw materials from buildings and infrastructure', lead to wider application of smart demolition techniques, C&amp;DW processing, quality assurance practices, traceability and standardization for secondary raw materials in the construction sector, thus improving the material and value recovery rate. </li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br>LC-CI<br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/eip/strategic-implementation-plan_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/raw-materials/eip/strategic-implementation-plan_en</a></p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/scientific-tool/raw-materials-information-system</p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>Capital expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditure (OPEX), internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV)</p><p id=fn4><a  target=_self href=#r4>[4]</a>http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/20509/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native</p>", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>1.

Results coming out of the project portfolio under this call should demonstrate the economic, environmental, climate and social added-value of decarbonised and circular production systems.</p><p>The cross-cutting nature of this call should lead to an improved cooperation and integration between sectors and value chains, and to making circular economy practices more mainstreamed and widespread and contributing to a carbon neutral industry in the medium term.</p><p>This call supports the development of innovative productions systems and business models, in which resource efficiencies, waste management and system thinking should be incorporated in the initial design, across sectors that are traditionally resource and energy intensive and/or with significant environmental footprints. The objective is the design and demonstration of profitable and sustainable (circular) value chains of materials, products and services, and of transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs between industrial facilities (industrial symbiosis). The environmental, climate, economic and social gains should be assessed from a comprehensive full life cycle perspective, including production and recycling processes, materials, and products (cradle-to-cradle).</p><p><strong>Portfolio approach as to the envisaged impact</strong></p><p>In order to strengthen the impact of the activities under the call, clustering of projects around certain activities into portfolios will be facilitated. This portfolio approach will be pursued to establish regular exchange of information between all projects under this call and to clarify thematic links across topics. Where relevant, clusters will be created to ensure optimal coordination between relevant projects, to promote continuous dialogue and exchange of good practices between all actors involved, improve communication and transfer of knowledge and to identify technological and non-technological barriers. Proposals are therefore encouraged to contribute be open to such clustering activities, including coordinated deliverables and joint dissemination or exploitation activities, with other projects selected under this call and under previous relevant ones. A workshop at the beginning of the projects will be organised to explain and put into practice this portfolio approach.[[SPIRE-13-2017, CIRC-01-2016-2017, SC5-04-2019]].</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 26, 2021 12:54:44 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 26, 2021 12:54:44 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results (<strong>Flash Call Info</strong>) can  be  found in the  &quot;Additional  Documents&quot;
