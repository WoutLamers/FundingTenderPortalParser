In general, practitioners\u2019 organisations have little means to free workforces from daily operations, and to dedicate time and resources to monitor innovation and research that could be useful to them. They have little opportunities to interact with academia or with industry on such issues.

The network should provide with human infrastructure organizing operations more efficiently and enable the coordinated use of interconnected information systems and national infrastructure in the whole region;</li>  <li>the Arctic and North Atlantic region: to prepare to cope as a network with the security threats that will result from the opening of the Northern passages, which are very important for the development of the region, but from which seaborne disasters are likely to arise. The current lack of infrastructure makes dealing with catastrophic incidents quite a challenge. The region needs to prepare, taking into account geographical specificities (climate-related, demographic, topologic, and in relation with the functioning of space-based systems;)</li>  <li>the Danube river basin: to enable an EU joint network concept for disaster resilience, so that the countries of the region, which faces natural disasters, particularly flooding in a repetitive manner, can benefit at most from the EU civil protection mechanism;</li>  <li>the Baltic region: to enable innovative border control cooperation e.g. with respect to smuggling and other security related issues, to the trafficking in human beings, to maritime surveillance, and to macro-regional risk scenarios and gaps identification; to support the Baltic Sea Maritime Functionalities flagship initiative</li> </ul><p>These networks should gather the largest number of Member States or Associated Countries.</p><p><strong>c</strong>. Entities from <strong>around Europe</strong> that manage <strong>demonstration and testing sites,</strong> <strong>training facilities, </strong>including simulators or serious gaming platforms in the area of CBRN and for first responders or civil protection practitioners, can get together to: 1) establish and maintain a roster of capabilities and facilities, and 2) organize to share expertise, and 3) plan to pool and share resources with a view to optimize investments.</p><p>Opinions expressed and reported by the networks of practitioners should be checked against what can be reasonably expected, and according to which timetable, from providers of innovative solutions.</p><p><strong>d</strong>.
