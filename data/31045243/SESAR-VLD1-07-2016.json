To this end, it has entered into cooperation arrangements with a number of international partners.</p><p>The awarded project is expected to set up a global demonstration that involves non-European regions and ATM actors. The consortium should show sufficient involvement of the required stakeholders for the success of the project (ANSPs, Airspace Users, Industries, global partners...).</p><p>With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.2 topic a).</p><p>This topic is about demonstrating that trajectory based operations can be performed with global interoperability using satellite data communication, navigation and surveillance as the enabler for seamless transitions. An essential objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining SESAR\u2019s Continental initial trajectory sharing concept (i4D EPP) with oceanic and Inter-continental operations. In particular the project is expected to prove that Satellite technology like Satcom can operate as a versatile enabler to global datalink without the need for aircraft to equip with as many avionics configurations as today. Additionally, the project is expected to take advantage of the ongoing initiatives on Satellite based surveillance over the oceanic airspace to demonstrate opportunities to reduce separation and enhance ATM performance.</p><p>Projects should ensure that they include content/scope of work leading to specific comments and recommendations relating to ICAO provisions and standardisation as well as towards Standards Making Organisations (SMO\u00b4s).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Trajectory-based operation includes the management of Trajectories focussing on the flight needs in 4 dimensions through the lifecycle of planning, execution and post-flight analysis. The aim of the TBO is as described in SESAR and ICAO to improve performance of air traffic operations and increase the overall predictability of the air traffic system. The 4D Trajectory (4DT) information set encompasses relevant trajectory flight data, including latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. NextGen and SESAR activities on this subject are well under way and have with a number of States and stakeholders agreements of the TBO concepts need of models for exchanging and sharing 4DT information.</p><p>The scope of the successful project should include the following elements at minimum:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>A significant number of Inter-continental revenue flights involving aircraft equipped with the required avionics supporting the capabilities for the demos.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Simultaneous use of satellite Communication, Navigation and Surveillance capability.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Enhanced ATM operations in continental and oceanic airspace</p> </li>  <li> <p>Initial trajectory exchange (i4D/EPP)</p> </li>  <li> <p>Satellite-based Communication, Navigation and Surveillance capability (eg Satcom, SBB)</p> </li>  <li> <p>Investigation of technical solution for Satcom that seamlessly operates in ATN-B2 and FANS environments</p> </li>  <li> <p>Investigation of technical solution for gateways accommodating both ATN/OSI and ATN/IPS in the same region.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Based on a significant number of Inter-continental revenue flights, the demonstration should operate Advanced ATM operations (i4D, PBN, enhanced arrivals/departures, reduced separations, IM\u2026) in the various phases of flight with CNS services being enabled by satellite solutions (Satcom, Satellite-based ADS-B and GNSS).</p> </li>  <li> <p>Production of public communication material (eg brochures, video, website\u2026)</p> </li> </ul><p>Applicants should demonstrate how their flying programme will provide the benefits expected to be derived from the project. Due to the complex nature of this project, the awarded consortium should demonstrate and implement strong level of project management and reporting principles (structure, milestones, intermediate steps, documentations, risk management\u2026).</p><p>Activities under this topic will focus on demonstrating the performance of SESAR enabled solutions with clear operational applications objective. Interaction with relevant demonstration platforms, in and outside of Europe is within scope, but most of the work should cover the ability of operational stakeholders to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged to improve performance in operational (or close to operational) environments.</p><p>The project should take advantage of the SESAR solutions (Full details of the SESAR Solutions can be found on the SESAR web site<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> or in the Solutions Catalogue<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>). In particular:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>Solution #115: Initial Trajectory Information Sharing :</p> <p>The airborne trajectory prediction performed by the Flight Management System (FMS) takes into account flight performance data that is updated in real time during the execution phase, such as descent planning information, aircraft weight, and the most updated temperature and wind predictions. This solution allows the downlinking of data based on the airborne trajectory prediction using the Extended Projected Profile (EPP), as defined by the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network Baseline 2 (ATN B2). The downlinked data is used by the ground systems to enrich their trajectory prediction.</p> <p> </p> </li>  <li> <p>Solution #109:Air Traffic Services (ATS) datalink using Iris Precursor:</p> <p>The solution offers a viable option for air traffic services (ATS) datalink using existing satellite technology systems to support initial four-dimensional (i4D) datalink capability. The technology can be used to provide end-to-end air\u2013ground communications for i4D operations, connecting aircraft and air traffic management ground systems.</p> </li> </ul><p>An example of a demonstration covering the requirements could be the following:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>The aircraft uses the SWIM services before departure for weather information and AOC coordination. AMAN/DMAN connectivity could be included as well.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Advanced departures could be performed in the take-off with for example noise abatement procedure.</p> </li>  <li> <p>All along the European Airspace, the aircraft is expected to perform ATN B2 initial trajectory sharing with CPDLC and ADS operating over Satcom. When appropriate, oceanic track entry could be optimised using the downlinked information. Over the Ocean, the demonstration could take benefit from the reduced separation enabled by Satellite based ADS-B combined with Communication capability enabled by the Satcom. Advanced Oceanic procedures could also be included.</p> </li>  <li> <p>When arriving to the destination, the aircraft could demonstrate enhanced queue management techniques and arrival procedures (Extended AMAN, PBN approaches, RNP to XLS transitions using the GNSS). The data communication will be operated over Satcom in the target region.</p> </li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The provision of Satellite enabling trajectory based operations will offer a solution for the long-haul carriers the possibility to significantly lower their procurement costs and benefit from versatile enablers to global interoperability without the need for aircraft to equip with as many avionics configurations in the absence of any additional service.</p><p>Due to non-radar coverage, the current lateral separation standard in the oceanic airspace is significantly greater than the standard in the continental airspace (approximately 4 times more conservative). Reducing the separation standard over the oceanic airspace, through the use of combined satellite based surveillance and communication will allow for a significant improvement in ATM capacity and performance.</p><p>Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>http://www.sesarju.eu/solutions</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/all-news/sesar-solutions-catalogue-and-interactive-map</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.
