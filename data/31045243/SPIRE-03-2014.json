These operations are also very energy-consuming, as they account for up to 45% of all the process energy used, for example, by the chemical and raw materials refining industries. Major improvements of these processes leading to more efficient and cost effective solutions are paramount in achieving a more sustainable European industry. </p><p>In this respect, hybrid technologies combining different techniques, such as distillation, membrane permeation, adsorption, extraction, etc. have already been applied successfully to a number of industrial processes. They can provide a cost effective solution to achieve major improvements in separation and fractionation operations, leading to waste reduction, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improved energy efficiency.</p><p>To realise the full potential of these technologies, further investigation and a deeper understanding are required of hybrid separation techniques (e.g. distillation, extraction, drying, crystallisation and reactive separation), in particular leading to a better understanding of how the different components interact with each other. This may also facilitate the transition from batch to continuous processes in the next generation of plants, increasing yield, purity and quality of products while improving productivity. </p><p>To enable the deployment of innovative highly-efficient separation and fractionation technologies in industry, the development of new approaches for the design and scale up of the overall production processes might also be required. If possible, these innovative approaches should regard the primary process and the downstream separation as one single, integrated process. </p><p>The aim is to provide innovative solutions for downstream processing, advance in the integration of different separation techniques into complex hybrid units and provide tools for the design of such units. </p><p><u>Scope:</u>The proposals should provide a proof of economic and industrial feasibility for the new technologies. The proposed solutions should also have potential for integration in the current industrial scenario, and should be suitable for different sectors in the process industry.

For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project.
