G8 principles on research data:</p><p><strong>(a)</strong> <em>Secure and agile data and distributed computing e-infrastructures</em>: fostering the integration of a secure, permanent, on-demand service-driven, privacy-compliant and sustainable e-infrastructure incorporating distributed databases, computing resources and software.</p><p>The European data and computing e-infrastructure landscape remains very fragmented which is an obstacle for research collaboration at European and global levels and introduces additional complexity for achieving sustainable governance. The challenge is to integrate at European level the geographically and disciplinary dispersed resources to achieve economies of scale and efficiency gains in providing the best data and computing capacity and services to the research and education communities. This action is interrelated to INFRADEV-04-2016, \u201c<em>European Open Science Cloud for Research</em>\u201d.</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> <em>Access and preservation platforms for scientific information</em>: supporting the integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure for reliable and permanent open access to digital scientific records, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.).</p><p>The European infrastructures need to respond to the emerging requirements for seamless and reliable access to publications, research data and software. These requirements are complemented by the need for long term preservation and curation of scientific information to fully support data and computing intensive science. The challenge is to support the integration at European level of a robust and sustainable e-infrastructure, based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic publishing platforms, aggregators, etc.) and services supporting European Open Access policies. An additional challenge is the building of capacity to link all kinds of digital research objects in order to enable a more transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results, enabling trust and facilitating access by innovative business actors.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary between them. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement</a> will be applied. The main purpose of the collaboration agreements referred to in Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement is to work on potential synergies, overlaps and gaps in the overall service offering. In addition, links should also be established with projects selected under topic INFRADEV-04-2016, to collaborate, exploit potential synergies and ensure complementarity.</p><p><em>Proposals will address part (a) or (b), but not both. At least one proposal for each part will be selected</em>:</p><p><em><strong>(a) Secure and agile data and distributed computing e-infrastructures </strong>(proposals should address all points below)</em>:</p><p>(1) integration of computing, software and storage resources exposing them through a dynamic <em>registry</em> and <em>catalogue of services</em> supporting European research and education communities in their tasks related with data and computing intensive science. This integration should be done by means of open and flexible architectures and include institutional, regional, national and European capabilities, packaging them in the optics of end-user needs</p><p>(2) seamless operation of highly scalable and agile data and computing platforms and services dedicated to analytics including hardware and software components, database, compilers, analytics software, supported to easy user entry points for the community of users</p><p>(3) reliably address the aspects of privacy, cybersecurity and information assurance supporting multiple compartments with private, public or industrial corpus of data, protected from unauthorized access by secure interfaces</p><p>(4) adoption of standards-based common interfaces, open source components enabling access and processing of underlying data collected/stored in different platforms and formats. Empowering users to customise application and services tailoring them to specific requirements, which will differ across disciplines, applications etc</p><p>(5) work closely with user communities (from different disciplines) to foster the use of digital infrastructures, promote the values of open science and support their data management plans. Engage and train users (researchers, educators and students) to contribute to the dynamic <em>registry</em> and <em>catalogue of services </em>improving quality of data, software and computing infrastructure that become available for re-use</p><p>(6) foster interoperability of pan-European thematic/community-driven e-infrastructures providing cost-effective and interoperable solutions for data management. The data and computing e-infrastructure should be able to interoperate with resources based on different technologies which are operated/owned by public and or private organisations</p><p>(7) support the preservation and curation of data and associated software so that the reproducibility and accuracy of the data can be verified</p><p>(8) enable seamless transition and e-infrastructure upgrades, exploiting economies of scale and promoting interoperability with similar infrastructures across and beyond Europe and operate user-friendly and comprehensive repositories of software components for research and education</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 and 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts</em>.</p><p><strong><em>(b) Access and preservation platforms for scientific information</em> </strong><em>(proposals will address all points below):</em></p><p>(1) Deployment and maintenance of service-driven knowledge e-infrastructure responding to general and specific requirements of researchers and research organisations for open access to research digital objects, their registration and preservation. This e-infrastructure will further develop the research capacity through a coordinated and participatory architecture linking institutional and thematic repositories across Europe. It will support publishing platforms by providing essential services for scientific information that can be used by humans and machines. Such target platforms can be generic, specific for a research field or specialised on quality assurance, discoverability, archiving etc. Essential functions of this service-driven approach will include helpdesks, training and guidance to support producers and users of scientific information, community building to support research data sharing and management, as well as implementation of Open Access policies in Europe. Relevant indicators on the take-up of open access in Europe including publications and data should be elaborated and reported regularly. The project will promote a limited set of biblio- and webometrics that reflect open access policies. It will collect bibliometric data on publications, citations, data citations, etc. on all Horizon 2020 scientific output (including on the Open Research Data Pilot) and produce both standard and on-demand statistics.</p><p>(2) Supporting global interoperability of open access data e-infrastructures and linking with similar initiatives across the globe to complement the physical access to research facilities with data access and to ensure that Europe plays a leading role in international collaborations.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 8 and 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong>(a)</strong> the operation of a federated European data and distributed computing infrastructure for research and education communities will optimise the access to IT equipment and services and will put all European researchers and educators in equal footing to access essential resources to express their talent and creativity. Establishing partnerships with industrial and private partners the e-infrastructure will train people in research and academic organisations preventing lack of skilled and specialised infrastructure operators. It will avoid the locking-in to particular hardware or software platforms that would jeopardise the long-term planning for capacity upgrades. With such an operational infrastructure more scientific communities will use storage and computing infrastructures with state-of-the-art services for their research and education activities. The open nature of the infrastructure will allow scientists, educators and students to improve the service quality by interacting with data, software and computing resources. It will increase the incentives for scientific discovery and collaboration across disciplinary and geographical boundaries, putting Europe in the driving seat at global level. It will further develop the European economic innovation capacity and provide stability to the e-infrastructure.</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> a reliable operation of e-infrastructure services for access and preservation of scientific information will make the intellectual capital of Europe available to researchers, business and citizens at large. It will generate economic and scientific advances now and in the future as that capital is safely preserved for further exploitation by future generations. Open Access publications resulting from Horizon 2020 funded research are available and easily findable online. Data needed to validate published results is linked to the publications and publicly shared whenever possible. Accurate science metrics for Horizon 2020 can be produced with almost no effort. Most of the European institutional repositories (at least 95%) as well as the principal thematic repositories are part of the same interoperable repository network.</p>\n<SPAN

Its implementation will be informed by the following principles:</p><p><strong><em>Service orientation:</em> </strong>The whole work programme aims at supporting a <em>service oriented European e-infrastructure landscape</em> catalysing new knowledge and innovative ICT solutions by global and multidisciplinary research. All projects will contribute to the production of a high quality catalogue of services describing the services that they will provide during the lifetime of the project or that they intend to develop during the project.</p><p><strong><em>Maximizing and assessing the impact of the e-infrastructures: </em></strong>Proposals should define, collect and make available key performance indicators (KPIs) in support of operational, technical and socio-economic impact assessment.</p><p>Proposals should plan for active participation in international <em>fora</em> and community-led consensus building initiatives to promote data and computing infrastructure interoperability such as the Research Data Alliance.</p><p><strong><em>Co-Design:</em> </strong>In order to successfully achieve the work programme objectives and to increase the scope, depth and economies of scale of e-infrastructures, the Commission encourages that consortia applying to all topics, in particular to those in the <em>platform-driven</em> and <em>user-driven</em> innovation themes, are composed by a balanced set of partners with complementary competences and roles.</p><p><strong><em>Open Research Data:</em> </strong>Producers and users of research data will benefit from more systematically opening it to broad access, depositing and accessing their data with the objective to make research data discoverable, accessible, assessable, intelligible, useable, and wherever possible interoperable \u2013 c.f. <em>G8 principles on research data</em>[[G8 Science Ministers Statement London UK, 12 June 2013 -<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1BtKagu\">http://bit.ly/1BtKagu</a>]].</p><p><strong><em>H2020 as a catalyst of the European plan for growth and jobs:</em> </strong>Horizon 2020 encourages synergies with other European Union Funds, with appropriate provisions not to cover the same cost items[[Article 17a of the Horizon 2020 Regulation and Article 31 of the rules of participation.]]. The e-infrastructures call for 2016-2017 will promote when feasible the combined and/or the cumulative use of other funding sources as instrument to support initiatives of European interest to foster growth and jobs[[\"digital game-changer\" on <em>European high-performance data networks</em>]].</p><p>The e-infrastructures call for 2016-2017 is structured along the following two themes:</p><p><strong><em>Theme 1 - Integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure platforms supporting European policies and research and education communities</em></strong></p><p>The integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure platforms covers the following aspects: (a) coordination of regional, national and European operations and funding (b) synergies between operational e-infrastructures (c) continuous upgrades of infrastructure without service disruption.</p><p>This theme will be covered by the topics EINFRA-11-2016 and EINFRA-12-2017 and the first point of the \"Research and Education Networking - GEANT\" part of G\u00c9ANT Partnership Projects (see <em>Other actions</em>).</p><p>The operation of e-infrastructure services will be funded by supporting the trans-national and virtual access activities provided to researchers. Those service activities shall comply with the conditions set out in Article 16.1 for trans-national access and Article 16.2 for virtual access to research infrastructures of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement</a>[[For grants awarded under this theme capitalised and operating costs of \u2018large research infrastructures\u2019 as defined in the Article 6.2.D.4 of the Model Grant Agreement are not eligible.]].</p><p>Under theme 1, only platforms and services based on systems and technologies that have at least achieved Technology Readiness Level 8 (TRL8)[[Technology Readiness Level, See Annex G for further details.]] before the start of the project will be supported. The services offered under a project must be adequately documented in an open catalogue of services and shall be periodically assessed by an external board approved by the Commission and common to all EC funded e-infrastructure services.</p><p>The projects funded under this theme should establish links with all projects funded under the Specific Grant Agreement (a) \"<em>Research and Education Networking \u2013 G\u00c9ANT</em> \" within the G\u00c9ANT Partnership projects included under \"Other actions\", in order to collaborate and work on potential synergies, overlaps and gaps in the overall service offering.</p><p>Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section \u201cSpecific features for Research Infrastructures\u201d. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.</p><p><strong><em>Theme 2 - Prototyping innovative e-infrastructure platforms and services for research and education communities, industry and the citizens at large </em></strong></p><p>e-Infrastructure platforms and services need to evolve through innovation actions to respond to the long-term needs of research and education communities, industry and the citizens at large. Innovative developments based on state-of-the-art technologies need to mature to be integrated and offered as dependable e-infrastructures. The support to e-infrastructure innovation is done by means of two types of activities: (a) <em>Platform-driven e-infrastructure innovation</em> (technology push, driven by the supply-side) and (b) <em>User-driven e-infrastructure innovation</em> (user pull, driven by the demand-side).</p><p>This theme will be covered by the topics EINFRA-21-2017 and EINFRA-22-2016, the second point of the \"Research and Education Networking - GEANT\" part of G\u00c9ANT Partnership Projects and the \"Interactive Computing e-infrastructure for the Human Brain Project\" (see <em>Other actions</em>).</p><p>Under theme 2, only platforms and services based on systems and technologies that have achieved at least TRL 6[[Technology Readiness Level.
