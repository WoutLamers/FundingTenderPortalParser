This is particularly critical for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)), vascular dementia, multiple sclerosis and metabolism-related central diseases (diabetes and obesity). It will be also important to understand the mechanisms of neurotropic virus-mediated BBB and brain penetration, and to be able to apply this knowledge for the development of innovative drug delivery systems, especially for biopharmaceuticals, and the identification of novel drug targets. Furthermore the various transport mechanisms and potential drug delivery systems that have been suggested so far need validation by independent researchers and the further understanding of challenges to advancing into clinical drug development by biotech/pharma.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The <strong>objectives</strong> of the project to be delivered from this topic are:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>establishment and characterisation of BBB models relevant for healthy and disease conditions for evaluation of disease-modifying agents (human <em>in vitro</em> cell based, in particular iPSC or progenitor-derived cells, and <em>in vivo</em>);</li>  <li>identification of translational readouts closer to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and mimicking altered BBB under disease conditions;</li>  <li>in-depth understanding of the biology of the BBB and characterisation of various transport mechanisms across the BBB (including virus-mediated BBB and Central Nervous System(CNS) penetration);</li>  <li>discovery and development of innovative and efficacious brain delivery systems.</li> </ol><p>These objectives could be attained through the milestones shown hereunder. Each of them could represent an independent work package and will be described later in the topic text:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>select specific genes and pathways expressed in endothelial cells of normal and/or diseased human brains or preclinical models;</li>  <li>validate <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> that these genes or pathways are responsible for normal/deficient/altered transport at the BBB and the impacts of disease development and progression on these genes or pathways;</li>  <li>this will enable the generation of improved BBB models for neurodegenerative/metabolic diseases predictive for the disease situation with optimized <em>in vitro</em>-<em>in vivo</em> correlation compared to established models; develop <em>in silico</em> models for predicting BBB penetration and pharmacokinetics of therapeutics in CNS;</li>  <li>identify and validate novel targets for brain delivery;</li>  <li>understand the mechanisms of neurotropic virus-mediated BBB and CNS penetration to inform innovative ways of brain-selective delivery.</li> </ol>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The use of \u2018healthy\u2019 and patient-derived specimens, inducible pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones and other types of progenitors offers compelling approaches due to the direct connection to patients with the underlying disease. The impacts of these new models could include: (1) yielding novel insights into currently identified BBB transport mechanisms for drugs, especially biopharmaceuticals, (2) allowing to use comparative assessment between \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018diseased\u2019 BBB, including in silico models, to prioritise some approaches for specific disease(s) because the transport mechanism is modified in the disease state, (3) leading to the identification and characterisation of novel transport mechanisms that are unaffected or upregulated in the disease or neurotropic virus-mediated, making them even more interesting, and (4) facilitating the discovery and characterisation of novel targets addressing the vascular aspect of neurological disorders like AD and thus open up novel routes for therapy.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>IMI2 12th Call for proposals topic text&nbsp;</strong>as well as the <strong>Call Conditions</strong> are available <strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_fiches/jtis/h2020-call-fiche17-12-imi2-ju_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>1.\tList of countries and applicable rules for funding</strong></span>: described in article 10(2) of Regulation N&deg; 1290/2013 of 11 December 2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 and in article 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) N&deg; 622/2014 of 14 February 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>2.\tEligibility and admissibility conditions: </strong></span>described in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-pse-imi-ju-v1.5_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>IMI2 Manual for evaluation, submission and grant award</strong></a>  See also the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) N&deg; 622/2014 of 14 February 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Proposal page limits and layout: Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>3.\tEvaluation</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSubmission and evaluation process, including evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold are described in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-pse-imi-ju-v1.5_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>IMI2 Manual for submission, evaluation and grant award</strong>.</a> See also the proposal templates for your specific action in section 5, below.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>4.\tIndicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</strong></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nNotification of outcomes of stage 1 evaluations: Maximum 5 months from deadline for submitting proposals.<br />\r\nNotification of outcomes of stage 2 evaluations: Maximum 5 months from deadline for submitting full proposals.</p>\r\n<p>Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>5.\tProvisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><u><strong>IMI2 Research and Innovation Action (IMI2-RIA) and (IMI2-IA):</strong></u></p>\r\n<p>Proposal templates are available after entering the submission tool<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_ptef/ef/h2020-call-ef-imi2-ria-ia-2016_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Standard evaluation form&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/mga/jtis/h2020-mga-imi_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">IMI2 Model Grant Agreement</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/h2020_tmpl-clinical-studies_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Clinical trial template</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the Clinical Trial template is compulsory at stage 2 only !<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><strong>6.\tAdditional provisions:</strong></span><br />\r\nOpen access must be granted to all scientific publications resulting from Horizon 2020 actions, and proposals must refer to measures envisaged.
