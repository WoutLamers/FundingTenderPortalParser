However, transport and energy are often treated separately within the FCH JU funding framework programme, thereby reducing the opportunities to demonstrate pioneer hydrogen economy models at territories levels.\u00a0 </p><p>Therefore, this topic aims to support territories where there is a strong political commitment to deploy ambitious and innovative hydrogen-integrated transport and energy demonstration projects in European Territories. </p><p>This particular \u201cHydrogen territories\u201d topic is focused on the deployment of hydrogen technologies in European isolated territories in order to prove the viability and feasibility of hydrogen economy concept in off-grid areas.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 To develop and deploy replicable, balanced and integrated fuel cell and hydrogen solutions in both energy and transport fields through strong partnerships between municipalities, industries and academia in European isolated territories disconnected to the main or national electrical grid. </p><p>These solutions will demonstrate an integrated hydrogen economy concept focused on small off-grid areas. The hydrogen territory proposals should primarily target transport and energy replicable demonstration applications such as vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution, MW capacity production of green hydrogen, hydrogen storage for balancing the grid and supply to a hydrogen refuelling station as well as large stationary fuel cell systems for distributed generation and other relevant commercial or industrial applications. </p><p>The proposals should address the following main areas: </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Near/fully autonomous hydrogen buildings/quarters/districts: through the integration of hydrogen energy storage chain coupled with renewable energy sources and including heat valorisation, backup power solution, and when applicable, supply to a vehicle hydrogen refuelling station (retail, public transport, or fleets)</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Zero emission mobility: through the integration of hydrogen refuelling infrastructures and provision of vehicle fleets powered by hydrogen for public and/or private transport, including logistics and/or freight-distribution.
