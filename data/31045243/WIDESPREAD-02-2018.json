In some countries, the situation has led to an underrepresentation of such countries in transnational collaboration. The different national research and innovation systems, approaches and instruments in these countries also add to the challenge. Furthermore, urban policy-making is often hampered by the limited cross-sector cooperation which does not allow a strong policy support that is based on scientific evidence.</p><p>Following the implementation of the actions foreseen by the Commission\u2019s Communication on Joint Programming to tackle Europe\u2019s major societal challenges of 2008, the Competitiveness Council has launched altogether ten Joint Programming Initiatives so far, among which is the Joint Programming Initiative \u2018Urban Europe - Global Urban Challenges, Joint European Solutions\u2019 (JPI Urban Europe)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>. The initiative enhances the knowledge and capacities to support urban transition towards sustainability in Europe and beyond. In doing so, it develops innovative solutions and reduces the fragmentation of urban-related research and innovation funding as well as builds critical mass and visibility. Several Council Conclusions on Joint Programming<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> invite the Commission to support JPIs via Coordination and Support Actions.</p><p>The development of the JPI Urban Europe is driven by a strong group of countries but as to the overall country participation, the initiative is seeking to widen the participation. Although efforts are taken by the JPI Urban Europe in this sense, the results can only be expected in a longer-term as this challenge is of the structural nature.</p><p>The use of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) is seen as an essential element to strengthen the implementation of new urban solutions and concepts in Europe. The Urban Agenda<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup> sets out a policy agenda for this and for EU urban policy in the wider sense. Many smart specialisation strategies include urban and smart cities related priorities and chart out the use of ERDF funding to develop and test new solutions for them. The Urban Innovative Actions identify and test innovative solutions for sustainable urban development.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> Also the JPI Urban Europe aims to create, validate and demonstrate knowledge and solutions. The ESI Funds could provide for both investments and implementation support. The challenge is how to create synergies, complementarities and coherence as well as alignment between the activities of the JPI Urban Europe and other existing resources such as the ESI Funds.</p><p>The outreach and opening of the JPI Urban Europe to third country partners is increasingly raising interest among the latter. Building on this momentum, the challenge is to further enhance the opening of the JPI to international cooperation and thus contribute to creating a coherent European Research Area that is open to international cooperation in the field of sustainable urban development. The challenge is how to consolidate the alignment of national, EU and international research and innovation programmes, which is one of the key objectives of Joint Programming Initiatives. In that regard, there is also a need to support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, in particular the Sustainable Development Goal on sustainable cities and urban settlements<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, building on related international activities taking place at United Nations level.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should aim to implement a solid opening-up strategy of the JPI Urban Europe, for enlarging participation of more European partner countries getting involved in the JPI initiative, including from Widening countries, and to further enhancing the commitment and broader participation of countries. Proposals should build on the coordination action \u2018EXPAND \u2013 Enhancing co-creation in JPI Urban Europe through widening Member State and stakeholder participation\u2019<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> that is expected to establish a Stakeholder Involvement Platform for the widening of participation and capacity building in terms of countries, regions, stakeholders and urban actors. In that regard, proposals should ensure the sustainability of the Stakeholder Involvement Platform. Proposals should engage a wide variety of countries in the activities of the JPI Urban Europe with the support of existing complementary resources such as the ESI Funds. In doing so, the proposal should build on the pilot activities implemented<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup> and establish further test beds for new instruments and for scaling up innovative solutions. Proposals should further professionalise the JPI Urban Europe programme management and further diversify various instruments for creating scientific evidence, innovations and the impact. Proposals should support the strategic processes of the JPI Urban Europe beyond 2020 and also establish mechanisms for the implementation of the future internationalisation strategy of the JPI Urban Europe<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup> that is under preparation. In doing so, proposals should investigate activities to align with and support the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, in particular, the Sustainable Development Goal on sustainable cities and urban settlements. </p><p>All participants in proposals must be legal entities which finance or manage publicly funded national or regional programmes in the urban-related research and innovation domains or which are institutions mandated to represent the country/region in JPI Urban Europe activities.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting lower amounts. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p> </p><p>- Increased scale and scientific quality of urban-related research and innovation activities as well as the overall coherence, complementarity and efficiency of the use of European research and innovation resources in this area including from Widening countries.
