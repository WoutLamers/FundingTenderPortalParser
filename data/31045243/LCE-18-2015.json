The EU needs to accelerate innovation in cutting edge low carbon technologies and innovative solutions, and bridge the gap between research and the market.\u00a0 A European approach is essential to realise the ambition of seeing low carbon technologies effectively developed in view of bringing them to the market: it allows key players to come together on a continental scale; it helps to identify and to tackle the barriers holding back innovative products and services in the single market; and it allows different sources of private and public funding to be brought together. Today, EU funding remains a limited part of the overall funding across Europe. Implementation needs to be increasingly based on partnerships that build the necessary scale and scope, and achieve greater impact from scarce public and private resources.</p><p><em><u>Scope:</u></em> The proposals should aim at coordinating the research efforts of the participating Member States, Associated States and Regions in the areas and challenges targeted in this 'Competitive low-carbon energy' call or in the \u2018Smart Cities and Communities\u2019 call and to implement a joint transnational call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding to fund multinational innovative research initiatives in this domain. Proposers are encouraged to implement other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. </p><p>Activities should focus on pre-commercial demonstrations and on validating solutions for these technology areas that accelerate their move towards commercialisation and competitive deployment, consistent with SET Plan objectives. Research activities necessary to support this work and forming an integral part of these proposals and solutions, will also be in scope for funding. </p><p>Appropriate user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take (e.g. e.g. regulatory issues, capacity building and access to finance), social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. Opening up demonstration facilities for practice-oriented education and training is encouraged. As regards a possible ERA-NET in the area of \u2018Smart Cities and Communities\u2019, cooperation with emerging countries (e.g. China) is encouraged, without prejudice of their participation as partners in other initiatives, such as in call for Smart Cities and Communities.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 10 to 20 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><em><u>Expected impact</u></em>: Acceleration of the time to market of, affordable, cost-effective and resource-efficient technology solutions to decarbonise the energy system in a sustainable way, secure energy supply and complete the energy internal market. Reduction of the environmental footprint and the energy payback time. Strengthening the European industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.</p><p><em><u>Type of action</u></em><u>:</u> ERA-NET Cofund</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=ERANET;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">ERA-NET</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: #003366\"><u><strong>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application</strong></u></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">1.
