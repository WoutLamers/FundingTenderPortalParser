The ERC Proof of Concept Grants aim to maximise the value of the excellent research that the ERC funds, by funding further work (i.e. activities which were not scheduled to be funded by the original ERC frontier research grant) to verify the innovation potential of ideas arising from ERC funded projects. Proof of Concept Grants are therefore on offer only to Principal Investigators whose proposals draw substantially on their ERC funded research.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b><i>Maximum size of grant and grant assessment</i></b></p><p>The financial contribution will be up to a maximum of <b>EUR 150 000</b> for a period of <b>18 months</b>. The ERC expects that normally, proof of concept projects should be completed within 12 months. However, to allow for those projects that require more preparation time, projects will be signed for 18 months. Given this initial flexibility, extensions of the duration of proof of concept projects may be granted only exceptionally.</p><p>The overall level of the funding offered will be assessed during the evaluation. The funding requested by the applicant will be judged against the needs of the proposed activity before award. The funding requested by the Principal Investigator must be fully justified by an estimation of the actual costs for the proposed activities. </p><p>The Union financial contribution will take the form of the reimbursement of up to 100% of the total eligible and approved direct costs and of flat-rate financing of indirect costs of a maximum of 25% of the total eligible direct costs. The level of the awarded grant represents a maximum overall figure \u2013 the final amount to be paid must be justified on the basis of the costs actually incurred for the project.</p><p>For further information please see the ERC Work Programme 2014.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff\"><strong>1) List of countries and applicable rules for funding</strong></span>: the conditions specific to the ERC are described in the <strong>ERC Work Programme 2014</strong> under the headings 'Eligible Principal Investigator', 'Eligible Host Institution' and in 'Annex 3'.
