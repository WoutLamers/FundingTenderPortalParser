A zero emission alternative for fossil fuel based (backup) power supply is needed. Excess electricity, from wind and solar renewable generation, can be converted into hydrogen and stored for re-electrification during periods of energy shortage.</p><p>Grid operators need power supply technologies on MW scale that have fast response times and excellent load-following capabilities. With such a technology they can facilitate efficient and reliable interaction with the grid on both transmission and distribution level, and ensure energy security for end users. Flexible hydrogen fuelled fuel cell power plants (FCPP) could be perfectly suited for this purpose as, compared to other technologies, they have very high efficiency, potential for fast and effective load-following capabilities, zero emission, and can be used for both short <em>and</em> long term grid support (winter months). Together with large (MW scale) rapid response electrolysers, which are developed and demonstrated in previous calls, large hydrogen-fuelled FCPPs have the potential to become one of the key enabling technologies for the future renewable energy based infrastructure of Europe.</p><p>1-2 MW size hydrogen FCPP\u2019s have both been built and successfully demonstrated via European programs in recent years. However, these systems, its fuel cells, and other key components were not designed for flexible dynamic power to power operation. Moreover, with the applied fuel cells and system design the required cost levels cannot be reached, even not if the units are built in high volumes. This is because the fuel cells applied were not designed for MW size applications, the system and component development was not well integrated, and a modular approach and capital equipment cost level (Capex) did not have priority. So, significant (design) improvements of the system and the fuel cells are required. Furthermore, we need experience how to connect flexible FCPP to the grid.</p><p>Only via a joint step-by-step innovative approach the European technology, the European supply/value chain, and the market can be further developed. Europe is still leading with large-scale hydrogen FCPP technology but the basis of the European supply chain is small. To be competitive with existing technologies (<em>e.g.</em> diesel gen sets), Capex of &lt; 1,500 Euro/kW is required to open this market for large-scale hydrogen FCPP technology.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Design of a <em>modular</em> highly flexible MW size fuel cell power plant for dynamic P2P applications of H2 and baseload operation to be connected to the grid.   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>Next to the complete design of the FCPP, it includes the design and development of key components and validation of their performance and scale up potential, with the purpose to optimise performance and minimise Capex for a MW size system (<em>e.g.</em> 2 MW).</li>    <li>The Capex reduction could for example be accomplished by a reduction in the materials costs, the number of components and connections, the production steps, costs power electronics, and most importantly the development of larger fuel cell stacks.</li>    <li>The chosen concepts should be modular and integrating manufacturability approach, resulting in a design that is fit for mass production.</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Validation via a pilot scale flexible FCPP in an industrially relevant environment and compatible with large scale manufacturing.
