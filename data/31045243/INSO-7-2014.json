The ERA-NET scheme has supported collaboration between Member States (MS) and their research programmes since the beginning of FP6. It has developed into a powerful tool creating joint transnational calls with a total volume of currently 2 billion \u20ac and a broad variety of additional activities between programmes that strongly support the realisation of ERA. Since its start in 2008, the joint programming process and the joint programming initiatives have gained considerable momentum and have led to the development of strategic research agendas, visions ahead and first joint activities, which in general have taken the form of common calls. The reinforced ERA Partnership calls on Member States to strategically align their national funding under common strategic research agendas. </p><p>What is now needed is moving forward to the implementation of common strategic research agendas, including joint actions with critical mass and alignment of national/regional activities. The specific challenge addressed by this action is how to realise a common approach to the preparation and implementation of joint activities and aligned national/regional activities, their monitoring and impact assessment as well as dissemination of results. This will involve the main stakeholders engaged in designing and deploying the broad structures and functions for the coordination and cooperation of national and regional research programmes. </p><p><u>Scope: \u00a0</u>Proposals should cover at least one of the following areas:</p><p>- Development and implementation of a user-led 'information, learning and support platform' for Public-public partnerships.</p><p>The action will support the information, monitoring and evaluation needs of all users, provide learning materials and functionalities including annual events and ensure the maintenance of a web-based portal with direct and indirect IT services. The action must take into account the experiences gained from current actions (ERA-LEARN, NETWATCH, JPI to co-work). Proposers must demonstrate the ability to respond to user needs of the main stakeholders involved in Public-Public Partnerships (P2P) and ensure a representative participation.</p><p>- Optimising modalities and implementation of Public-Public Partnerships</p><p>Actions must be user \u2013led and support improved and coherent implementation of P2Ps, e.g. the further development and common application of Framework Conditions for JPIs, the support for the development and implementation of a Joint Programming 'Knowledge Hub' concept for Less Research Intensive countries or other conceptual and methodological approaches.</p><p>- New modalities for aligning national/regional activities under common research agendas</p><p>The action should assess and benchmark current approaches and support stakeholders to introduce or scale up new approaches that allow Member States and funding bodies to increase competition, excellence, and impact in their national activities (calls for proposals, institutional funding, etc.) that implement commonly agreed research agendas. </p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 million and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact: </u>The action will contribute to increasing efficiency of public administrations. It will support the implementation of innovative concepts between Members states and funding bodies, and contribute to higher standards in joint programming between Member States. Monitoring and analysis will deepen the understanding of the functioning of P2P and their impact at European, national and regional level. The action will provide further opportunities to share experiences and develop common approaches among the main stakeholders engaged in designing and deploying the broad structures and functions for the coordination and cooperation of national and regional research programmes. Furthermore, the on-line platform will enable better use of research results across borders.</p><p><u>Type of action</u>: Coordination and support actions</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\">&nbsp;</span><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
