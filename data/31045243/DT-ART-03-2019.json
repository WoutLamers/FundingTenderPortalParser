In highly automated driving conditions (SAE automation level 4) the role of the driver will change dramatically since driver intervention is not required during defined use cases. This means that during a single trip there will be a coexistence of different automated driving functions demanding various degrees of human attention. When a vehicle is in highly automated driving mode the driver may take on different behaviours. Solutions need to be developed and they have to ensure both a safe transfer between use cases with different automation levels and that drivers always have a very clear understanding about the degree of automation enabled in each situation.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals for research and innovation should focus on the design of safe human-machine interfaces for vehicles with highly automated driving functions and the safe and controlled transfer between use cases of different SAE automation levels (between level 4 to/from levels 3 or 2) for all types of drivers.</p><p>The proposed actions should include all of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Research to characterise driver roles in use cases of SAE automation level 4 and for the transition between these and lower automation levels. Upgrade of comprehensive models for driver behaviour/reaction, awareness, readiness and monitoring. Driver generational effects, considering in particular variations in IT usage experience and age, but also other cultural factors should be taken into account.</li><li>Effectiveness assessment methods, especially for safety aspects, based on these models. The new relationship between driver and vehicle (mutual cooperation or even handover rather than continuous control) should be reflected, also considering the variety of activities a driver may engage in while the vehicle is in charge. Use cases where an operator controls the vehicle remotely may be included.</li><li>Develop easily understood solutions making it clear to the driver what is the operational capability (authority) of the automated mode or modes currently enabled, as well as ensuring safe and reliable function (re-)allocation and corresponding driver/operator readiness. Driver control handover, driver/operator state and impairment are among the aspects that should be considered and the intended driver reaction should be secured.</li><li>Demonstration of concept functionality in real world situations with various use cases and driving environments where automated systems receive and give back control from/to the driver.</li> </ul><p>Proposed actions should build on the knowledge and results of ongoing projects addressing human machine interactions of automated driving systems.</p><p>In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies. Twinning with Japan is also encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 to 8 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Innovative solutions, concepts and algorithms for a safe human-machine interface of highly automated driving functions and for safe and controlled transfer between use cases of different automation levels.</li>  <li>Reduction of risks for driver behaviour related incidents by ensuring that drivers/operators are adequately alerted, made aware and engaged when the highly automated vehicle encounters situations or use cases that it cannot handle and thus will turn to lower automation levels.</li>  <li>The research will help achieve the European Transport White Paper \"Vision Zero\" objective by preventing road accidents caused by human errors.

Many demonstration projects are already ongoing where automated driving functions are tested in different use cases. The previous call on \"Automated Road Transport\" in the Transport Workprogramme 2016/17 focused on vehicles with functions for automated driving level 3, which are expected to enter the market in the next few years.</p><p>The overall objective of this call is to promote a wide market introduction of highly automated driving systems towards SAE level 4[[Definition of SAE Level 4 \u2013 High Automation: \"the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene\".]]. The call will focus on large-scale demonstrations to test the performance and safety of innovative highly automated driving systems for passenger cars, efficient freight transport operations and shared mobility services in urban areas. Furthermore the changing role of the driver and how to account for it by human centred design of automated vehicles will be addressed.</p><p>The Call 2018-2020 Automated Road Transport is part of the Focus Area \"Digitising and transforming European industry and services\". Demonstrations will look at testing the use of digital, connectivity as well as satellite navigation technologies for optimised connected and automated driving functions (including the EGNOS and Galileo). Digital technologies, such as Big Data, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence techniques provide a great potential for developing innovative automated driving functions and mobility solutions for the future. Communication and cooperation of automated vehicles with other vehicles, infrastructure and other road users can increase the safety, comfort, productivity and the enabling of innovative business models of automated vehicles and improve the efficiency of the overall transport system.</p><p><em>By supporting innovative connected and automated driving technologies and mobility solutions, the call will help to create new global market opportunities for European industry and strengthen the position of Europe as a world leader in innovative mobility. Actions under this call are expected to contribute to more road safety as well as to better traffic flow, less congestion, fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. New shared and fully automated mobility services can help decrease the total number of cars on the road, alleviating the overall traffic. Actions will contribute to UN's Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and 3.6 (By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents).</em></p><p>In addition to the topics of this call, actions related to \"Automated Road Transport\" are included in the \"Mobility for Growth\" call of this part of the Work Programme as well as in other parts of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020. The call \"Mobility for Growth\" includes topics on \"Human Factors in Transport Safety\" (MG-2.1-2018), \"Safety in an evolving road and mobility environment\" (MG-2.4-2019), \"New regulatory frameworks to enable effective deployment of emerging technologies and business models\" (MG-4.2-2018) and \"Driver behaviour and acceptance of connected, cooperative and automated transport\" (MG-3.4-2019), which refer to connected and automated systems and technologies of all transport modes. Cooperation and cross-fertilisation of concepts and technologies across transport modes developed in the different proposals is strongly encouraged. The LEIT/ICT work programme includes a topic on \"5G for connected and automated driving\". This topic addresses the applicability of 5G connectivity to \"Connected and Automated Driving\" use cases.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:13:04 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:13:04 PM", "content": "<p>On 28 April 2020, a total of 8 full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2020 topics:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nDT-ART-05-2020 (IA) &ndash; 4 proposals <br />\r\nDT-ART-06-2020 (IA) &ndash; 4 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:20:27 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:20:27 PM", "content": "<p>Reacting to the Covid-19 crisis, the submission deadline for the following topics has been extended to 28 April 2020 17:00:00 Brussels time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDT-ART-05-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nDT-ART-06-2020 (IA)</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:57 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DT-ART-06-2020(IA), DT-ART-05-2020(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:16:29 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:16:29 AM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">On 25 April 2019, a total of 19&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2019 topics:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">DT-ART-03-2019&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">DT-ART-04-2019 &ndash; 8 proposals&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:04 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:04 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DT-ART-03-2019(RIA), DT-ART-04-2019(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:51:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:51:08 PM", "content": "<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">On 4 April 2018, a total of 14&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2018 topics:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">DT-ART-01-2018 &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">DT-ART-02-2018 (RIA) &ndash; 5 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">DT-ART-02-2018 (CSA) &ndash; 5 proposals&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:20:01 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:20:01 PM", "content": "<div><strong>IMPORTANT - Page limits applicable to proposals:</strong></div>\r\n<div>Applicants are allowed to remove the page break in the cover page of the template for the technical annex, i.e. the proposal text can start on the cover page.</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:35:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:35:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: DT-ART-02-2018(RIA), DT-ART-01-2018(RIA), DT-ART-02-2018(CSA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
