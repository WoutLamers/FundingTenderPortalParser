The integrated production of other bulk products together with the targeted high value added products could increase the cost competitiveness of the biorefinery concept. Although the production of biomass from a number of cultured algae and aquatic plants has been proved at pilot scale, the challenge is to reduce the costs of the extraction and conversion processes in order to achieve cost-competitive concepts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Development of innovative multi-step approaches for the separation of the chemical components present in aquatic biomass and their cascading conversion, maximising the valorisation of biomass components into high added value applications such as ingredients for food, polymers, feed proteins, cosmetics, chemicals, pharma, nutraceuticals. Proposals should include the optimisation of the separation, extraction and purification processes and evaluation of the bioactive (e.g. nutritional, antimicrobial and antibiotic) properties in view of their application in the corresponding markets. A life-cycle assessment of the entire process should be performed, taking into account requirements from the addressed markets. Proposals should assess the impact of the developed processes on the environmental, social and economic performance of the whole value chain. Strong weight will be put on industrial leadership to fully exploit the developed products/processes. </p><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget in the range of EUR 2-5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
