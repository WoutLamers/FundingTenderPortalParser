Copernicus data and information are mainly made available on a free open and full basis. This is expected to unleash unique market opportunities. It is important to foster market development exploiting the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web) across different market segments through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.</p><p>For such applications and developments to succeed in the market, the product needs to be shaped according to users\u2019 needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users\u2019 workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&amp;D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals may address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and its smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. To this aim, a business model and a value chain market analysis, which includes the phase of the project following the end of the public funding, should be part of the proposal.</p><p>The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product. Transnational collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it enhances access to markets beyond the national borders, notably by enabling space application providers to absorb market-related tacit knowledge and know-how of their partners. Corresponding validations and customisations are to be undertaken, and the business case for the application is to be demonstrated. Service level models are to be developed, with appropriate quality of service definitions for the application. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services including data processing, visualisation and cataloguing.</p><p>The choice of EO application is left to the proposer.</p><p>Proposers are advised to consult information on the Copernicus programme in general at <a href=\"http://copernicus.eu/\">http://copernicus.eu</a>, and to consult further information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals at the Commission\u2019s website<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p><p>To reinforce continuity of skills, proposers could consider associating post-graduate researchers.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Establish sustainable supply chains for innovative EO value added products and services with demonstrated commercial value with targeted client communities. Complete integration, based on international standards, into the customer\u2019s existing business processes and processing chains, as well as the economic viability of the application is to be demonstrated; </li>  <li>Enhance the European industry\u2019s potential to take advantage of market opportunities and establish leadership in the field, and to boost business activity; </li>  <li>Lead to new or improved products, processes or services on the market, by industry including SMEs, which are capable of generating, after the end of public funding, turnover and thus create new jobs. </li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"http://www.copernicus.eu/main/data-access\">http://www.copernicus.eu/main/data-access</a></p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

Through Copernicus and Earth Observation activities in the Horizon 2020 the European Union also contributes to advancing the Global Earth Observation Systems of Systems (GEOSS).</p><p>In particular, activities under the societal challenge for climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials focus on GEOSS, notably the development of comprehensive and sustained global environmental observation and information systems that stimulate the smart use of strategic resources, support the development of evidence-based policies, foster new environmental and climate services, and develop new opportunities in global markets. Activities under the Leadership in Industrial Technologies part focus on the evolution of Copernicus and the exploitation of existing European space infrastructure by promoting the development of innovative products and services based on remote sensing, geo-positioning or other types of satellite enabled data as well as geo-information generated already by services such as Copernicus services.</p><p>Moreover, taking into account the wider relevance of EO to all parts of Horizon 2020, proposals addressing application and uptake of EO for the development of innovative applications addressing specific challenges can also be submitted to the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenges where related references are included. To that end, applicants to those parts of Horizon 2020 can also access Copernicus data and information (licensing conditions may apply)[[Access to Copernicus Sentinel data and service information is provided to users on a free, full and open basis.
