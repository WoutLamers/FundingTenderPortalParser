To be more effective and increase the added value of related investments, the efforts and strategic research agendas of the many funding networks and organisations existing in Europe need to be integrated to establish transnational and trans-disciplinary research and innovation actions.</p><p><u>Scope:</u>Proposals should address the following:</p><p><b>[2014]</b>Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding to support the priorities identified in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Water Joint Programming Initiative (JPI). Proposers should also consider implementing other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. In 2014, this call should support research and innovation developing technological solutions and services to support the implementation of EU water policy, in particular for water distribution and measurement, waste water treatment and reuse, desalination, floods and droughts etc.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u>: Better use of scarce human and financial resources in the area of water R&I. Reduced fragmentation of water research and innovation efforts across Europe. Improved synergy, coordination and coherence between national and EU funding in the relevant research fields through transnational collaboration. Improved implementation of research and innovation programmes in these fields through exchange of good practices.
