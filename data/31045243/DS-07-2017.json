These challenges are being addressed through innovative approaches that cross the boundaries of individual H2020 pillars, calls and challenges. Therefore the main research &amp; Innovation activities in Digital Security are grouped in a dedicated focus area cutting across LEIT\u2013ICT and Societal Challenges parts of the work programme, including evidently the Societal Challenge 7 on \"Secure Societies\", but also the Societal Challenge 1 on \"Health, demographic change and wellbeing\".</p><p>In July 2016, the European Commission, in partnership with Industry, established the <strong>Cybersecurity contractual Public-Private Partnership (Cybersecurity PPP)</strong>[[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry]]. The Cybersecurity PPP gathers industrial and public resources to deliver innovation against a jointly-agreed roadmap for strategic research and innovation.</p><p>The Cybersecurity PPP will help to align the demand and supply sectors for cybersecurity products while also seeking synergies to develop common, sector-neutral technological building blocks with maximum replication potential e.g. encrypted storage and processing, secured communication, etc.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the &lsquo;Additional documents&rsquo; section on the topic pages.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "content": "<p>A total of 160 proposals have been submitted in response to this call.
