Harnessing the expertise of social sciences and humanities (SSH) in ICT-related research and innovation is key to contribute, notably, to cohesion, fairness, and inclusiveness. Although the need for a constructive, reflective and critical interactions between social sciences and humanities, on the one hand, and technological disciplines, on the other hand, is widely acknowledged, it is a challenge to make it happen and ensure that insights and innovation stemming from both perspectives join up in order to deliver inclusive ICT-enabled innovation. It calls for a smart approach to multiple disciplinarity<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> that combines different tools and relies on the dynamic uptake of social sciences and humanities' perspectives. With this in mind, a structured distributed approach to the mainstreaming of social sciences and humanities across all topics aiming at ICT-related research and innovation has been set up. This approach strives to nurture a horizontal and mutually enriching relationship between SSH and ICT communities. For responsible and inclusive innovation to come true, one has to move beyond a reactive and risk-based approach, and encourage ongoing critical accompaniment of this innovation, rather than seeking mere acceptance of technological artefacts. This expands the remit of what is expected from SSH expertise. Instead of being confined in a \"watchdog\" or an \"airbag\" role for S&amp;T developments, SSH is itself a source of innovation<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic calls for the coordination and support action that will bring life to the distributed and structured approach designed to ensure a responsible approach to research and innovation thought the uptake of SSH expertise across all H2020 areas leading to ICT-related innovation. It should act as a \"hub\" and activate the constructive interactions of SSH research with the ICT-related projects across H2020.</p><p>The purpose of the hub is to stimulate responsible and inclusive ICT research and innovation by encouraging the uptake of the SSH expertise in ICT-related projects and by coordinating and supporting the embedded expertise within the H2020-funded ICT-related projects, as well as linking these H-2020 projects with the relevant SSH expertise and initiatives both in Europe and in the world, to ensure that this important knowledge basis is fed into the H2020-funded ICT related research and innovation. The coordination and support action is expected to generate in a collaborative way a shared understanding what it takes for ICT research and innovation to be responsible and inclusive, and to make it happen.</p><p>In terms of <strong>coordination</strong> efforts, the hub is expected to ensure an active dialogue and the sharing of experience among ICT developers, SSH researchers and other stakeholders (NGOs, citizens and users e.g.) across H2020 ICT-related projects<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. It is also expected to channel the fruits of this dialogue into discussions with policymakers, into the shaping of future research agendas, and into a reflexive assessment of the SSH research practice in the remit of the digital transition.</p><p>In terms of its <strong>supporting</strong> function, the hub will catalyse information sharing about activities in Europe that are enhancing responsible and inclusive approaches to ICT-related research and innovation. Drawing on ongoing developments, it will provide tools and advice for fostering responsibility and inclusiveness of ICT research and innovation. It will support the visibility of the relevant activities through sustained communication efforts (annual conferences, awareness raising, interactive web-based platform e.g.). It will encourage debates on the challenges raised by hyper connectivity and support experimental activities in interactive labs to stimulate reflection on cutting-edge issues.</p><p>The Commission will select one proposal only and considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Improved level and efficacy of the interaction between SSH and ICT disciplines with a view to harnessing ICT-related innovation for reversing inequalities and contributing to responsible and inclusive innovation processes through SSH expertise;</li>  <li>Improved take-up of societal concerns in ICT-related research and innovation;</li>  <li>Increased worldwide visibility and influence of a European community with a shared vision for inclusive ICT research and innovation;</li>  <li>The proposals themselves are expected to identify key measurable success indicators \u2013to be further framed in the course of the project- that measure impact in community building and engagement, and uptake of inclusive responsible ICT research and innovation approaches within and beyond the consortium.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&amp;I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders.

Large disparities in human and social capacities are counterproductive to a sustainable and creative economy and participatory governance and inclusion. They jeopardise economic growth while threatening the very foundations of democracy, the rule of law and respect of human rights in Europe. These questions have to be analysed from a theoretical perspective and practical solutions to overcome inequalities have to be recommended.</p><p>For more inclusive societies to take shape in the medium term, coherent visions will need to be devised on how to foster a social and economic framework that promotes fairness and sustainability in Europe as key policy objectives, while enhancing social dialogue, respecting the continent\u2019s diversity and considering the global context.</p><p>The current migration crisis calls for a better European coordination of research on migration and asylum as well as a cross-national comparative research on migration. Two specific Platforms are envisaged in this call. In addition a research action on employability, skills, and labour market integration of migrants will provide new and policy relevant knowledge on this subject.</p><p>The rise in inequalities in Europe and other parts of the world comprises hitherto unknown quantitative and qualitative dimensions: in the wake of the financial and economic crisis, highly increased levels of inequality (e.g. income and wealth concentration, gender inequality) can be detected alongside novel types of inequalities (e.g. debt inequality, inequality in access to justice or political life, spatial inequality). Options to reverse inequalities should be evidence-based and suggested at EU level.</p><p>These recent trends will need to be fully understood and effectively tackled through comprehensive research and innovation activities. Based on a sound understanding of inequality trends, policies and measures aimed at reversing various kinds of inequalities need to be examined. Different options for policies and measures (e.g. social dialogue, tax policy, new forms of evidence-based education, public service innovation, welfare state reforms, labour market, employment and consumer policies and practices) should be identified and their usefulness be compared. Specific emphasis should be given to the objective of reversing territorial inequalities, equal enjoyment of human rights and the conditions enabling comprehensive urban policies, the mobile provision of social services and an equal access to ICT use.</p><p>Most of the Topics of REV-INEQUAL concern primarily the EU, although a certain number of issues clearly have an international dimension. This is particularly the case for Topic 2 on radicalisation, Topic 4 on mobility, and Topics 11, 12 and 13 on migration. The content of these Topics is linked with the ENG-GLOBALLY call (Topics 1, 3 and 10) and with the Societal Challenge 7 Topic SEC-06-FCT-2016: \u201c<em>Developing a comprehensive approach to violent radicalization in the EU from early understanding to improving protection</em>\u201d. In these Topics the participation of entities from the international partner countries and regions concerned is strongly encouraged.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: REV-INEQUAL-09-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-12-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-13-2017(RIA), REV-INEQUAL-11-2017(CSA)</p>\r\n<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-REV-INEQUAL-2016-2017<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Thursday 2 of February 17 Pm 2017.
