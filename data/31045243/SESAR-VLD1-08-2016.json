To this end, it has entered into cooperation arrangements with a number of international partners.</p><p>The awarded project is expected to set up a global demonstration that involves non-European regions and ATM actors. The consortium should show sufficient involvement of the required stakeholders for the success of the project (ANSPs, Airspace Users, Industries, global partners...).</p><p>This demonstration involves the Airspace Users (AUs), the DCB (Demand and Capacity Balancing) units and the ANSPs (Air Navigation Service Providers) as well as their supporting manufacturing industries in the pre-operational demonstration for the ICAO FF-ICE (Flight and Flow in a Collaborative Environment) step 1 implementation following available ICAO guidance and material. As such, the focus is on the exchange of pre-departure flight data information and applying distribution mechanisms as defined in the ICAO ATMRPP (draft) provisions.</p><p>The demonstration will be conducted in a global context in collaboration with international partners, implying that the established interoperability will have a focus beyond the European boundaries. Data exchanges have to be based on the globally standardized FIXM 4.0 format (Flight Information Exchange Model, see <a href=\"http://www.fixm.aero/\">www.fixm.aero</a>) including the 4DT (4-Dimensional Trajectory), the FSPD (Flight Specific Performance Data) and the GUFI (Globally Unique Flight Identifier).</p><p>Optional activities include the usage of SWIM B2B services for the exchange of updated route planning during the execution of the flight between AU, DCB and ANSP.</p><p>With reference to the SJU Annual Work Programme 2016, this topic covers Section 3.5.4, sub Work Area 2.2 topic b).</p><p>Consortia applying for this topic must include at least one AU, and may include additional entities provided their role in supporting the demonstration from the AU perspective is adequately justified in the proposal.</p><p>SESAR will reach out to its existing network of international partners. In addition an active contribution is expected from the participating parties by using their own global network to expand the community of international partners participating to the SESAR FF-ICE/1 global demonstrations. To demonstrate such active contribution, a letter of intent of non-European partners of consortium members for participation to the global demonstration, could be included in project proposals, bearing in mind that the non-European partner\u2019s effort is not eligible for funding through this call. This approach is similar to the approach used in the SESAR SWIM Global Demonstration 2016.</p><p>This demonstration will not only serve as a demonstration, but also serve as a validation of effectiveness of the global interoperability aspects of the ICAO FF-ICE/1 provisions and the supporting FIXM 4.0 elements.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The main scenario is to have an AU with or without supporting CFSP (Computer Flight plan Software Provider) submit an eFPL (Extended Flight Plan) as a filing request to the DCB and participating ANSPs and for those ANSPs to respond accordingly, followed, if necessary, by the required update by the AU.</p><p>The expected involvement of parties answering to this open call shall be in accordance to the following terms of reference:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li> <p>Demonstrations will be conducted using pre-operational systems using operational flight data.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Providing and/or consuming the 4DT (4-Dimensional Trajectory), the FSPD (Flight Specific Performance Data) and the GUFI (Globally Unique Flight Identifier) is mandatory.</p> </li>  <li> <p>Optional demonstrations would aim at demonstrating the use of B2B services for post departure route planning update, and providing feedbacks on the management of an updated route along the ATM chain (including Flow Management units, ATC, AOC, pilots)</p> </li>  <li> <p>Participating AUs shall operate outside Europe to one or more regions of one or more international partners of SESAR, and contribute to the demonstration with these intercontinental flights.</p> </li> </ul><p>The following potential demonstration activities are presented to assist applicants to scope their proposals.

The global demonstration will also serve as a validation of the ICAO FF-ICE/1 provisions and the supporting FIXM 4.0 elements, and may therefore result in further refinement of these provisions and supporting information exchange model.</p><p>Results of the demonstration should quantify performance improvements resulting from the demonstration flights, using, as a minimum, relevant KPAs from the performance framework defined in the ATM Master Plan</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.
