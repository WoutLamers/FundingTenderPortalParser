Such deployment requires availability of a cost effective and reliable hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. State-of-the-art hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) technologies show part-wise unsatisfactory reliability reducing the availability of hydrogen as fuel for FCEV drivers related to failures in compressors, pumps and other vital parts. End user satisfaction is a key success factor for FCEV deployment especially in the early phase when the number of HRSs is low. Moreover, the relatively high CAPEX of HRSs is related to costly components and to high HRS complexity. Simplifications in system design, development of modular solutions and novel concepts for reducing the number of required components constitute viable pathways towards lower cost hydrogen supply. At low dispensed volumes the CAPEX and HRS maintenance contributes significantly to the hydrogen fuel cost. As the number of FCEVs increases, next generation HRS should be expandable to capacities following the demand for hydrogen. Last, but not least, there is a significant potential for improving the overall refuelling energy efficiency, thereby reducing the OPEX, which is required to reach the targeted fuel supply cost.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 Project(s) should conduct R&D, engineering, prototype manufacturing and/or laboratory testing of key components or complete HRS systems with the aim to further reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve and verify availability and refuelling performance. The focus of these activities needs to ensure that remaining hurdles for commercialisation and specific market requirements are appropriately addressed with the best possible technological solution.\u00a0 For components the project efforts should focus on technologies with a current TRL of at least 3 and ensure an increase during the project of at least up to TRL 5.
