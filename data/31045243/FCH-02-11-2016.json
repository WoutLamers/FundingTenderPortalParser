Europe has a total of only 2 MW of such fuel cells installed.</p><p>Such large installations demonstrate the capability of the technology, raise needed volume for cost reduction and provide best of class total cost of ownership (TCO).</p><p>To jump-start this first commercialisation phase, the industry needs dedicated demonstrations with selected promising suppliers/technologies16 in order to clear the way for a volume increase in the market, which is concomitant to the required decrease in capital costs. This should open pathways to allow full commercial deployment with shrinking public funding, taking into account the full added values of what large FCs can offer to the European energy system.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This demonstration activity will focus on MW or multi-MW demonstration in order to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi MW stationary FC\u2019s in a commercial/industrial application, also relative to the use of heat, for which the needed heat recovery equipment is included</li>  <li>Demonstrate the feasibility (technical and commercial) for MW or multi-MW stationary FC in large commercial or industrial applications, also relative to process integration of heat or heat/cold.</li>  <li>Establish confidence for further market deployment actions in other sectors, e.g. next demonstration of MW or multi-MW solutions for grid support</li>  <li>Prepare the ground for successful implementation of European stationary MW-class fuel cell industry (technology and manufacturing settlement) and to achieve further reductions in product cost and development of the value chain</li>  <li>Demonstrate the technical performance as required in a grid with large share of variable renewables.</li> </ul><p>Core features of the FC such as efficiency, cost, durability and lifetime must comply with relevant MAWP targets and the global competition; these values have been compiled on the expected impact chapter.
