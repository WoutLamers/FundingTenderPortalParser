Insecure ICT is also imposing a significant cost on users (individuals and organisations) who have to mitigate the resulting risk by implementing additional technical and procedural measures which are resource consuming.</p><p>Smart systems, highly connected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are introducing a high dynamism in the system to develop and validate. Hence, CPS are evolving in a complex and dynamic environment, making safety-critical decisions based on information from other systems not known during development.</p><p>Another key challenge is posed by domains, such as medical devices, critical infrastructure facilities, and cloud data centres, where security is deeply intertwined and a prerequisite for other trustworthiness aspects such as safety and privacy.</p><p>The challenges are further intensified by the increasing trend of using third party components for critical infrastructures, by the ubiquity of embedded systems and the growing uptake of IoT as well as the deployment of decentralized and virtualized architectures.</p><p>In order to tackle these challenges, there is a need of appropriate assurances that our ICT systems are secure and trustworthy by design as well as a need of certified levels of assurance where security is regarded as the primary concern. Likewise, target architectures and methods improving the efficiency of assurance cases are needed in order to lower their costs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><u>a. Research and Innovation Actions - Assurance</u></p><p>Providing assurance is a complex task, requiring the development of a chain of evidence and specific techniques during all the phases of the ICT Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC for short: e.g. design verification, testing, and runtime verification and enforcement) including the validation of individual devices and components. These techniques are complementary yet all necessary, each of them independently contributing towards improving security assurance. It includes methods for reliability and quality development and validation of highly dynamic systems.</p><p>Proposals may address security, reliability and safety assurance at individual phases of the SDLC and are expected to cover at least one of the areas identified below, depending on their relevance to the proposal overall objectives:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Security requirements specification and formalization;</li>  <li>Security properties formal verification and proofs at design and runtime</li>  <li>Secure software coding;</li>  <li>Assurance-aware modular or distributed architecting and algorithmic;</li>  <li>Software code review, static and dynamic security testing;</li>  <li>Automated tools for system validation and testing;</li>  <li>Attack and threat modelling;</li>  <li>Vulnerability analysis;</li>  <li>Vendor (third-party) application security testing;</li>  <li>Penetration testing;</li>  <li>Collection and management of evidence for assessing security and trustworthiness;</li>  <li>Operational assurance, verification and security policy enforcement;</li>  <li>Adaptive security by design and during operation.</li> </ul><p>Proposal should strive to quantify their progress beyond the state of the art in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Particular importance within this context should be placed on determining the appropriate metrics.</p><p>Proposals should take into account the changing threat landscape, where targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats assume an increasingly more important role and address the challenge of security assurance in state-of-the-art development methods and deployment models including but not limited to solutions focussing on reducing the cost and complexity of assurance in large-scale systems.</p><p>Proposals should include a clear standardisation plan at submission time.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5; please see part G of the General Annexes.</p><p><u>b. Innovation Actions \u2013 Security Certification</u></p><p>Proposals should address the challenge of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of existing security certification processes for state-of-the-art ICT components and products including the production and delivery of the corresponding guidance materials.</p><p>In terms of effectiveness, proposals should address, amongst other factors, emerging threats, compositional certification and reuse of components in the context of certified systems and certification throughout the operational deployment of a product or a service.</p><p>In terms of efficiency, proposals should strive to reduce the cost and duration of the certification process.</p><p>Proposals may address security certification in any area of their choice. Consortia submitting proposals are expected to approach the selected topic as widely as possible including all necessary actors \u2013 e.g. industry, academia, certification laboratories - and involve the relevant certification authorities from at least three Member States in order to achieve added value at a European level.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to work towards moderate to high assurance level protection profiles as a way to validate their results.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>The outcome of the proposals are expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 to 7; please see part G of the General Annexes.</p><p><u>c. Coordination and Support Actions</u></p><p>To complement the research and innovation activities in security assurance and certification in this topic, support and coordination actions should address the following:</p><p>Building trustworthiness: economic, legal and social aspects of security assurance and certification</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Study in depth the economic and legal aspects related to assurance and certification (including European-wide labelling), EU and International regulatory aspects;</li>  <li>Explore and identify the interplay of relevant social, cultural, behavioural, gender and ethical factors with ICT systems with regards to their trustworthiness and security, actual or perceived</li>  <li>Identify barriers and incentives in the market for certified products in the consumer and/or enterprise market;</li>  <li>Produce a comprehensive cost/benefit model for security assurance and certification;</li> </ul><p>Engage with multidisciplinary communities and stakeholders.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

These challenges are being addressed through innovative approaches that cross the boundaries of individual H2020 pillars, calls and challenges. Therefore the main research &amp; Innovation activities in Digital Security are grouped in a dedicated focus area cutting across LEIT\u2013ICT and Societal Challenges parts of the work programme, including evidently the Societal Challenge 7 on \"Secure Societies\", but also the Societal Challenge 1 on \"Health, demographic change and wellbeing\".</p><p>In July 2016, the European Commission, in partnership with Industry, established the <strong>Cybersecurity contractual Public-Private Partnership (Cybersecurity PPP)</strong>[[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry]]. The Cybersecurity PPP gathers industrial and public resources to deliver innovation against a jointly-agreed roadmap for strategic research and innovation.</p><p>The Cybersecurity PPP will help to align the demand and supply sectors for cybersecurity products while also seeking synergies to develop common, sector-neutral technological building blocks with maximum replication potential e.g. encrypted storage and processing, secured communication, etc.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the &lsquo;Additional documents&rsquo; section on the topic pages.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "content": "<p>A total of 160 proposals have been submitted in response to this call.
