Scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services have been a key component of forward-looking decision making as they contribute to i) better understanding and synthesizing a broad range of observations, ii) informing decision makers about future impacts of global changes such as climate change, land use change, resource overuse, invasive alien species or pollution, iii) providing decision support by developing adaptive management strategies, and iv) evaluating the implications of alternative social-economic development pathways and policy options. </p><p>Development of scenarios for biodiversity and ecosystem services, based on the understanding and modelling of their dynamics and the evaluation and reanalysis of past changes, is beginning to receive high priority in the research policy of the majority of countries worldwide. In this context, aligning research agendas and implementing them through international calls will promote synergies and optimal use of the available expertise and resources, avoiding duplication and ensuring robust outcomes of global relevance. To attain this, BiodivERsA is opening to third country partners and the Belmont Forum provides an excellent platform for international collaboration.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (and as needed local and regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals with EU co-funding resulting in grants to third parties. The proposal should include other joint and follow-up activities, including possibly additional joint call(s) without EU co-funding. The proposal should demonstrate that these co-funded other activities exclude any overlaps with ongoing actions of this ERA-NET co-funded by the EC. Actions should build on the strategic roadmap of BiodivERsA ERA-NET Cofund and launch at least one international call on biodiversity and ecosystem services scenarios in collaboration with the Belmont Forum specifically to promote trans-continental collaboration. Cooperation and coordination with other ERA-NETs and/or JPIs to increase synergies on cross-cutting issues, where appropriate, is encouraged.</p><p>Participation of legal entities from international partner countries and/or regions, particularly from countries participating in the Belmont Forum, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities without EU co-funding. For the co-ordination costs of additional activities only, participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> may nonetheless request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost).</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Actions are expected to lead to: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>the alignment of research and innovation agendas in the area of scenario development for biodiversity and ecosystem services and co-ordinated streamlining of the implementation of at least one call; </li>  <li>enhanced excellence and global relevance of research and innovation activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services, improving the relevance and value of advances made in developing socio-economic scenarios and models of global change impacts on the dynamics of biodiversity and ecosystem services for decision makers at multiple scales;</li>  <li>increased visibility of European biodiversity scientific community and research outcomes at international level; </li>  <li>strong and lasting alliance with the funding agencies of key international partners for research and innovation actions on biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g Brazil, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, USA); </li>  <li>link with possible assessments as those conducted, e.g., by the IPBES to induce a wider, worldwide and regional use of scenarios to better assess future, plausible trends of biodiversity and ecosystem services and explore the role that nature-based solutions may play;</li>  <li>contribution to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 15 'Protection, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss'.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=ERANET;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">ERA-NET</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/international-cooperation_en.htm</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nWithin this systemic approach, the Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' will focus on research and innovation which unlocks private and public investment in future solutions for a resource efficient, climate smart economy with a sustainable supply of raw materials. There is a consistent need to demonstrate Europe's potential for systemic innovation and market uptake of technological and non-technological solutions through large-scale demonstration projects. A transformative agenda on this scale requires major changes in attitudes and behaviour patterns and the contribution of social sciences and humanities will be essential to inform successful solutions. Complementary research and innovation activities are organised around the demonstration projects. Societal Challenge &lsquo;Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials&rsquo; will act as trailblazer for ensuring that the investment of 35% for climate action and 60% for sustainable development across the whole Horizon 2020 Framework Programme will deliver maximum impact for economic, environmental and social sustainability.<br />\r\nThis systemic approach is in line with Horizon 2020's Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) cross-cutting objective, engaging society, integrating the gender and ethical dimensions and ensuring access to research outcomes. The ethical dimension of the activities, including relevant socioeconomic implications, should be taken into account, such as personal data protection and privacy, protection of participants and researchers, ensuring informed consent, dual use and potential misuse of the research results, fair benefit sharing when developing countries are involved, animal welfare, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Given the transnational, global nature of climate change and the environment, and their scale and complexity, as well as of the raw materials supply chain, activities cover both EU level and beyond, thus contributing to the Commission's priority &lsquo;A Stronger Global Actor&rsquo;. International co-operation aims to boost the effectiveness of the actions promoted, within a scale-and-scope approach, e.g. GEO and the IPCC. Third countries, regions and international partners or programmes have been selected in order to maximise the impact and accelerate progress, e.g. the Belmont Forum. With regard to the broader international sustainability and climate change agenda, activities funded under Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' are expected to have an impact on the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, as well as on that of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015 (The Paris Agreement is subject to ratification of Parties).</p>\r\n<p>The cross-cutting nature of the issues addressed by this Societal Challenge results in a number of research and innovation areas which can most effectively be developed jointly with other Horizon 2020 parts (Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and other Societal Challenges), and in complementarity with other programmes e.g. LIFE, the Natural Capital Financing Facility (NCFF) under the LIFE programme, or the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Coherence and synergy with actions at national, regional or local levels, via the ESIF and links to EU Presidencies, and with other initiatives such as Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs) and the European Institute for Innovation and Technology&rsquo;s (EIT) Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), is also reinforced.<br />\r\nIn addition to the call H2020-SC5-2016-2017 'Greening the economy', activities relating to climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials are also found in the calls:<br />\r\nH2020-IND-CE-2016/17 'Industry 2020 in the Circular Economy&rsquo; (on eco-innovation),<br />\r\nH2020-SCC-2016/17 'Smart and Sustainable Cities' (on sustainable cities through nature-based solutions),<br />\r\nH2020-BG-2016-2017 &lsquo;Blue growth &ndash; demonstrating an ocean of opportunities' (on the Arctic),<br />\r\nH2020-SFS-2016-2017 &lsquo;Sustainable Food Security &ndash; Resilient and resource-efficient value chains&rsquo; (on Earth Observation for Africa),<br />\r\nH2020-LCE-2016-2017 'Competitive low-carbon energy' (on applied geo-sciences) and in the SME Instrument call H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Applicants can find additional information on the respective areas of the call in the text of the WP 2016-17.
