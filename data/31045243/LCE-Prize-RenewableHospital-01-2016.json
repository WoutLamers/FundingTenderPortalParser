Partly, it is due to unpredictable fluctuation of some renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind. The difficulty is even greater in cases where a 100% security of energy supply is essential such as for hospitals and especially when several renewable energy sources are used.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This inducement prize will reward a hospital that has an innovative and within its premises perfectly integrated combined heat and power (CHP) installation. This installation has to use at least three different European renewable energy technologies, include energy storage component(s) and be able to provide 100% of hospital's annual needs for energy consumption. In this context any renewable energy source is allowed.</p><p>The prize will induce innovative renewable energy solutions integrating several technologies into one energy system. Installing such kind of integrated equipment in the ecosystem of a hospital would not only ensure the security of its energy supply, but would also raise public awareness on renewable energy. Moreover, the prize aims to mobilise and enhance private and public investments for replication of similar solutions in Europe and worldwide.</p><p>The specific rules of contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.</p><p>Indicative prize amount: EUR 1 million.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The prize winner will be the entrant (a hospital) that has installed and operated in its premises a new combined heat and power system integrating at least three different renewable energy technologies and with an innovative energy storage component. The proposed energy system solution shall be adaptable and replicable to other sites. Clear energy security and economic benefits shall be proven to assure these replications.</p><p>The prize will accelerate the introduction of renewable energy sources at larger scale. It will also encourage new venues for installing flexible and reliable CHP units from different renewable energy sources with zero carbon footprint. The contest gives as well a good opportunity to local small and medium-sized enterprises to demonstrate their expertise and know-how.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting pilot activities is excluded from the delegation to INEA and will be implemented by the Commission services.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </strong></span>described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-chp-hospital_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">     </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Eligibility and exclusion criteria:</span></strong> described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-chp-hospital_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><br />\r\n    </em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the application template.<em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Evaluation and award criteria and procedure:</span></strong> described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-chp-hospital_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u>.</a> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>&nbsp;Indicative timetable for evaluation and award of prizes:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-chp-hospital_en.pdf\">Rules for Contests</a>.</span> <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li>A<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>pplication templates and evaluation forms for prizes under this topic:</strong></span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Application template for inducement prizes&nbsp;is available after entering the submission tool below.<u><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_at/h2020-prizes-induc-at-chp-hospital_en.pdf\">     Evaluation form for inducement prizes</a></u><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>Additional provisions:</strong></span> described in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-chp-hospital_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u>.</a> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong><br />\r\n    The general rules for Prizes</strong></span> are described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-f-prizes_en.pdf\">part F of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Additional documents</span></strong>:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a>  <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-euratom-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Euratom Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme</a> <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;
