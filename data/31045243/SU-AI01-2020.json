From the Law Enforcement point of view, these dimensions have to be analysed in a longer term, taking into account that the potential AI benefits for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) are threefold, i.e., through: 1) proactive policing (from reactive to anticipative policing); 2) data analysis (e.g., connecting the dots, discovering criminal patterns and defragmenting LEA actions), and 3) identity checks (improving detection, targeting and interdiction).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals under this topic should provide an EU AI roadmap for LEAs, meeting their specific operational and cooperation needs, by identifying, in a longer-term perspective: the key areas in which AI would be beneficial for LEAs, the key areas in which it could pose a threat to security, cybersecurity requirements for AI based technologies in use or to be used by LEAs as well as means of prevention and mitigation of malicious use of AI for criminal activities. As such this project would not only need to continuously interact (in a cluster mode) with projects funded under SU-AI02-2020 and SU-AI03-2020 but also provide recommendations for further work to be done under Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, or the Internal Security Fund as well as for policy and market uptake. The objective is to develop a research roadmap that provides answers to, e.g., following questions: What are and will be the AI needs of LEAs in their daily work? What are the major research gaps in the area of AI in support of LEAs? What are the challenges that need to be addressed, both from the fighting crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, and from improving cybersecurity (re)actions? Which approaches might be desirable? What needs to be set up for test and evaluation? How to prevent and mitigate malicious use of AI for criminal activities and terrorism?</p><p>Starting from these considerations, proposals must demonstrate commitment to produce recommendations that are updated continuously, and at least every 6 months, about the following lines of actions: which AI based technologies, systems and solutions could support/enhance the work of LEAs and how, what the corresponding restraints (including ethical and legal) are, as well as related risks, security challenges and protection measures. The proposal shall provide specific real-life LEAs scenarios, examples and evidence supporting their recommendations. The proposing consortium is expected to incorporate relevant security practitioners, researchers, civil society organisations and LEAs.</p><p>As indicated in the Introduction of this call, proposals should foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Short term:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Effective contribution to the overall actions of this call;</li> </ul><p>Medium and longer term:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>In the longer term perspective, identification of key areas in which AI would be beneficial for LEAs, meeting their operational and collaborative needs, and of key areas in which it could pose a threat to security;</li><li>A carefully planned roadmap in order for Law Enforcement to benefit as much as possible from the AI based technologies, systems, solutions, including their protection;</li><li>Increased awareness regarding the state of the art and trends in AI-based criminal activities (short-, mid- and long-term).</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>JOIN(2017) 450</p>", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>1.

[[\u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2013 A European Perspective\u201d, EUR 29425 EN, 2018.]] There are many different technologies that fall under this broad AI definition and they very much refer to machine learning, data science, robotics, internet of things and use of big data. Furthermore, many applications of AI have already started to appear in our everyday lives, from image recognition to machine translations or music generation, or very soon might become our reality, such as connected and autonomous vehicles or medical diagnostics. However, it is not always clear how best to foster innovation and how best to raise awareness about potential benefits and risks of this promising technology. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity.</p><p>To address the challenges and make the most of the opportunities offered by AI, the Commission published a European strategy[[COM(2018) 237.]] in April 2018.</p><p>The Commission proposed an approach that places people at the centre of the development of AI (human-centric AI) and encouraged the use of this powerful technology to help solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges, such as fighting crime and improving cybersecurity.</p><p>In order to improve the competitiveness of Europe in AI, it is necessary to map the existing research excellence and to boost and facilitate technology uptake. At the same time it remains indispensable to safeguard the strategic autonomy of the EU when developing security systems using AI technology by finding ways of embracing the opportunities offered by AI.</p><p>In December 2018, the Commission adopted a Communication on Working together for Artificial Intelligence [[COM(2018) 795 final.]] containing a Coordinated Action Plan, which has been drawn up jointly with Member States. With the Coordinated Action Plan, the Commission intends to maximise the impact of investment at the EU and national levels, encourage cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices, and support the EU\u2019s global competitiveness in this sector. Security aspects of AI are prominently present in all actions of the adopted plan, from research until putting such technologies on the market.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission is committed to embed the discussion on the risks and opportunities associated to AI in a wider development strategy for security, taking into account various scenarios, needs, gaps and alternatives that are specific to each area of security.</p><p>Moreover, under the next programming period beyond 2020, the Commission proposed to invest at least 1 billion EUR per year from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programmes into AI based technologies.[[COM(2018) 795 final.]] With the Digital Europe Programme, the Commission has put forward for the first time a dedicated programme to reinforce the EU's digital capacities in key technologies that might be further complemented by other funding instruments such as the Internal Security Fund, the future Border Management Fund or by the European Structural and Investment Funds.</p><p>AI is also becoming a topic of interest for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in Europe. Many Member States and Associated Countries have on-going initiatives to modernize the work of LEAs in this sense. However, AI asks for a significant technical and financial investment, due to which smaller countries may lag behind. Bringing this issue at EU level provides several advantages, such as possible economy of scale, centralized solutions on the issue of huge amount of data needed, or development of EU standards in this domain.</p><p>In order to scale up AI capacities of LEAs across Europe, close their AI skills gap, create synergies and tackle more efficiently their major challenges, it is essential to reach a critical mass through a close cooperation among the LEAs, research teams and industry. In such a way, the initiative would pave the way for a possible future establishment of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement, as a gravitational point of all AI-efforts related to LEAs, which would also, among others, contribute per se to achievement, when appropriate, of a European Strategic Autonomy in this critical dimension.</p><p>Such a European AI hub for LEAs should build on the AI-on-demand platform and be, where appropriate, linked to it so as to facilitate sharing of new technologies and advances across domains.</p><p>In addition, such a hub would serve as a common reference testing and experiment facility (could be a virtual network of physical facilities) to test state-of-the-art technology in the context of LEAs, taking into account all the technical and non-technical constraints imposed by the field (economic, legal, structural, organizational,\u2026). This hub could also include regulatory sandboxes, in order to test practical solutions in environments where the regulatory context might need to be adapted or defined.</p><p>A European AI hub would support LEAs by improving their daily work and quality of the tools they have, by increasing the protection of these tools and of LEA infrastructures, as well as by diminishing the number and impact of technologically sophisticated crimes. Thus, four interconnected aspects need to be addressed within this hub in order to exploit various possibilities of AI to provide full support to LEAs:</p><p>1- How can AI help LEAs in preventing, detecting and investigating criminal activities and terrorism and in monitoring borders?</p><p>2- At the same time, in order to support LEAs in their work, how can the malicious use of AI tools for criminal activities and terrorism be prevented, including malicious use of the AI tools developed in point 1?</p><p>3- Then, how can the AI tools used by LEAs, including the ones in point 1, be protected against cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>4- Finally, how can AI help in protecting LEA infrastructures from cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>AI can bring benefits to cybersecurity and to the fight against crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, but will introduce new challenges as well, some of them related to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To this end, a close cooperation of different national Law Enforcement and judiciary systems is necessary in order to secure the existence and availability of large enough and up-to-date high-quality datasets at a European level.</p><p>All topics in this call will be subject to security scrutiny.</p><p>Projects under this call are implemented through the use of complementary grants. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Proposals shall therefore foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices. This task will contribute to the actual set-up of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement at a later stage.</p>\n<p>The Commission reserves the possibility under this call to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">H2020-SU-AI-2018-2019-2020</span></b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:&#10;12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">A total of 23<b> proposals have been submitted </b>in response to this call.
