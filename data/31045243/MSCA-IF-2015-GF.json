The scheme particularly supports the return and reintegration of researchers from outside Europe who have previously worked here. It also develops or helps to restart the careers of individual researchers that show great potential, considering their experience.</p>\r\n<p>Scope:</p>\r\n<p>Support is foreseen for individual, trans-national fellowships awarded to the best or most promising researchers for employment in EU Member States or Associated Countries, based on an application made jointly by the researcher and host organisation in the academic or non-academic sectors.</p>\r\n<p>Fellowships are either European Fellowships or Global Fellowships. European Fellowships are held in EU Member States or Associated Countries and are open to researchers currently within and outside Europe. The country where the European Fellowship is held is subject to the rules of mobility. Global Fellowships are based on a secondment to a third country and a mandatory 12 month return period to a European host. The country where the Global Fellowship secondment takes place is subject to the rules of mobility, whereas the return phase is not.</p>\r\n<p>Return and reintegration of researchers into a longer term research position in Europe, including in their country of origin, is supported via a separate multi-disciplinary reintegration panel of the European Fellowships. For the reintegration panel, there shall be mobility into Europe.</p>\r\n<p>Support to individuals to resume research in Europe after a career break, e.g. after parental leave, is ensured via a separate multi-disciplinary career restart panel of the European Fellowships. To qualify for the career restart panel, researchers must not have been active in research for at least 12 months immediately prior to the deadline for submission.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers receiving an Individual Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase in Europe, notably in the non-academic sector, within the overall duration of their fellowship. For a fellowship of 18 months or less, the secondment phase may last up to three months. For a fellowship of more than 18 months, the secondment phase may last up to six months. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. The secondment should significantly add to the impact of the fellowship.</p>\r\n<p>A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, planning for publications and participation in conferences.</p>\r\n<p>Expected impact:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Individual Fellowships are expected to add significantly to the development of the best and most promising researchers active in Europe, in order to enhance and maximise their contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The action will also strengthen the contact network of both the researcher and the host organisation.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The fellowship will contribute to realising the full potential of researchers and to catalysing significant development in their careers in both the academic and non-academic sectors.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; Some researchers will be resuming a research career in Europe after a break, or reintegrating within Europe after living abroad.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 22, 2016 3:42:28 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 22, 2016 3:39:53 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (Flash Call Information) is now available under the tab 'Call documents'.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 18, 2016 10:44:56 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 18, 2016 10:44:11 AM", "content": "<p>Indicative timetable:<br />\r\n- An indicative date for informing the applicants about the outcome of the evaluation is on Friday the 22nd of January 2016.
