A fast growing percentage (currently 72%) of the EU population lives in urban areas, using 70% of our energy. Quality of city life and the attractiveness of cities as environments for learning, innovation, doing business and job creation are now key parameters for success in the global competition for talent, growth and investments.</p>\r\n<p>Key challenges for Smart and Sustainable Cities are to provide solutions to significantly increase cities' overall energy and resource efficiency through actions addressing the building stock, energy systems, mobility, climate change, water and air quality. Such actions should bring profound economic, social and environmental impacts, resulting in a better quality of life (including health and social cohesion), competitiveness, jobs and growth.</p>\r\n<p>This &ldquo;Smart and Sustainable Cities&rdquo; cross-cutting focus area has the aim of bringing together cities, industry and citizens to demonstrate solutions and business models that can be scaled up and replicated, and that lead to measurable benefits in energy and resource efficiency, new markets and new jobs. The scope will include the creation of urban spaces powered by secure, affordable and clean energy, smart electro-mobility, smart tools and services, innovative nature-based solutions and showcasing economic viability.</p>\r\n<p>Particular focus will be on creating the right enabling frameworks for large-scale innovation at urban scale, including the development and testing of new business, financing and governance models that allow for quick replication at scale.</p>\r\n<p>This cross-cutting call on Smart and Sustainable Cities comprises two distinct but mutually reinforcing parts.</p>\r\n<p>Smart Cities and Communities (SSC1) focusses on demonstrating sustainable, cost-effective and replicable district-scale solutions at the intersection of energy and transport enabled by ICT. They should integrate smart homes and buildings, energy efficiency measures, very high shares of renewables, smart energy grids, energy storage, electric vehicles and smart charging infrastructures.<br />\r\nThe call continues with the 'lighthouse city' approach of the Smart Cities calls since 2014. The 2020 goal is to have a significant number of new lighthouse cities of all sizes all over Europe, in a very large number of Member States with various, climatic and economical positions.</p>\r\n<p>Sustainable cities though Nature-based solutions (SSC2-4) focusses on providing evidence that re-naturing of cities through the deployment of innovative, locally adapted, systemic solutions - that are inspired and supported by nature - can be a cost-effective and economically viable way to make cities more sustainable, resilient, greener, and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>This will also help to increase their attractiveness for citizens, new economic activities and investments. The replication of successfully demonstrated solutions can be further spread by the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities.</p>", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Dec 5, 2017 11:01:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 5, 2017 11:01:54 AM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"><strong>Flash Call Info:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>An overview of the evaluation results of Stage 2 of&nbsp; the Two stage call of H2020-SCC-2016-2017 (flash call info) is now available under the &quot;Additional documents&quot; section on the topic page.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jun 6, 2017 5:56:31 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 6, 2017 5:56:31 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>Flash Call Info</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>In order to best ensure equal treatment, successful stage 1 applicants do not receive the evaluation summary reports (ESRs) for their proposals, but a<strong> <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\">GENERALISED&nbsp;FEEDBACK</span></strong> with information and tips for preparing the full proposal.
