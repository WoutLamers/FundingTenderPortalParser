Focus, design and delivery mechanism of innovation support programmes determine to a large extent the economic impact from the supported actions and the satisfaction of the beneficiaries with the support provided. The European Union has in different programmes, including for example the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), the Competiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and INTERREG, supported mutual policy learning and exchange of \u2018good practices\u2019. However, the transfer of good practices in SME innovation support, the enhancement of existing and the establishment of new innovation support programmes for SME remains slow; and SMEs benefitting from support programmes still often remain dissatisfied with the services received<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>The PRO-INNO Europe 'INNO-Partnering Forum' (IPF, 2009-2012) has made some significant contributions to formulating the requirements for a permanent learning mechanism for SME innovation support agencies<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>: learning activities have to be based on clear methodologies and they have to be demand driven, launched at the moment agencies themselves recognise the need to revise programme formats. Furthermore peer learning activities need to benefit from a secretariat or an animation structure that assures horizontal flow of information among interested agencies. In a collaborative exercise the IPF has developed two methodologies in this respect: a quality management system implemented through a peer review system based on the EFQM methodology and a 'twinning+' methodology that combines elements of traditional peer reviews and twinning in small learning groups of interested agencies.</p><p>It is the objective of this action to make available to national and regional innovation agencies these two methodologies as elements of a permanent peer learning environment and to give incentives to the agencies to engage more frequently in peer learning activities.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The proposed activities will provide incentives in the form of small lump sum grants to national and regional innovation agencies for engaging in peer learning on all topics relevant for design and delivery of innovation support programmes for SMEs. The support to joint learning activities shall be available at any time when need and opportunity for policy learning in agencies arises. Peer learning is open for all topics for a better innovation support to SMEs. In the context of this action however, only the 'Twinning+' methodology as well as the quality management scheme for innovation agencies based on EFQM are recognised as learning methods. Participating agencies will be entitled to grants in the form of lump sums (EUR 15.000 / 50.000)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>.</p><p>.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>The number of innovation agencies engaged in peer learning activities significantly increases.</li>  <li>The results of the peer learning are taken up by national and regional innovation support programmes, including those co-financed by European Structural and Investment Funds.</li>  <li>A broad range of new topics and approaches in innovation support to SMEs is investigated and developed by peer learning activities of national and regional innovation agencies.

A strong rationale exists for public support to SMEs\u2019 innovation activities in order to overcome market failures specific to SMEs and to fully realise their growth potential. The public supports \u2018SME innovation\u2019 with grants, subsidised loans, equity and a wide range of innovation support services. However, SMEs receiving innovation support often remain dissatisfied with the services they receive; while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided. The nature of innovation is changing: open data, open software, open hardware design and crowd-funding make it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources \u2013 but the challenge arises from scaling these initial offerings to create growth and jobs. Social innovation is required at the interface between public services and private enterprise to maintain the high standard and security of living in Europe. While small enterprises face challenges in recruiting talent - among others as a result of increased mobility \u2013 researchers have problems pursuing academic careers and work below their qualifications.</p><p>As the nature and environment for innovation changes the public innovation support has not only to follow those developments but also become proactive in shaping them.</p><p>The following call for proposal is one element of a broader action to develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Where appropriate, a highly specialised support service may be established at European level to complement existing national and regional services. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, peer-learning and uptake of new approaches. In the work programme 2016-17 emphasis is put on testing three new approaches to a better innovation support in large pilot actions that should deliver results in time for the start of discussion on the next framework programme for research and innovation. The Enterprise Europe Network, present in all European regions and co-financed by them, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to play an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (4th April 2017- 17:00:00), a total of 73 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2016-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-03-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-07-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "content": "<p>H2020-INNOSUP-02-2016 SME Innovation Associate - at the closing&nbsp;date (30&nbsp;June 2016 17:00:00 BLT), a total of 192 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (6 April 2016 17:00:00), a total of 97 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>INNOSUP-02-2016- SME Innovation Associate: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate-essential-tips-your-application\">essential tips to applicants </a>were published.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-02-2016(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-02-2016: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/h2020-sme-_innovation-associate-presentation.pdf\">Additional Information for Applicants </a>are published on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate\">H2020 SME Innovation Associate webpage </a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-04-2016(CSA-CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-05-2016-2017(CSA-CSA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
