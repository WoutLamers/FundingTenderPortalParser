It <em>can be derived from many different sources such as </em>such as agricultural and agro-industrial residues, forest or forest industry residues, woody crops and residues from existing biomass conversion plants<em>. Their use alleviates competition with food production and </em>increases income opportunities, especially in the agricultural and forest sectors. Technological solutions exist at pilot scale for the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into chemicals and high added value products. However, further technological development in terms of improving energy consumption and yields is needed with view to optimise the environmental impact and demonstrate their cost-competitiveness.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Demonstration of the techno-economic viability of the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock into 2<sup>nd</sup> generation sugars and lignin in a cascading approach, and further into chemical building blocks or high added value products. Proposals should address one or both of the following applications:</p><p>(i) Di-carboxylic acids from lignocellulosic sugars and their further conversion to end-products.</p><p>(ii) High added value products from lignocellulosic raw materials like high value fermentation products, (fine) chemicals, polymers, food additives or pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Proposals should identify the most effective feedstock/process combinations and will address, where relevant, the presence of inhibitor compounds affecting the conversion processes. Products and processes should be benchmarked against fossil based alternatives and/or conventional biomass-based products in terms of cost-competitiveness, quality and sustainability. Proposals should include activities to assure economical and sustained access to sufficient sustainable raw material to set up the new value chain. In order to meet the market requirements, the verification and validation of safety, quality and purity of end products should also be considered. Proposals will assess product demand and will consider market pull related activities (e.g. standardisation, consumers\u2019 perception) aimed at facilitating the market uptake of the developed products. A life-cycle assessment on the environmental and socio-economic performances of the developed processes and products should be carried out. The leading role of relevant industrial partners is considered essential to achieve the full impact.</p><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 15 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another budget.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Reducing the environmental impact and CO<sub>2</sub> footprint with respect to traditional processes (either fossil based and/or produced from conventional feedstock).</li>  <li>Products that have a 2 - 3 times higher value than current products from these raw materials.</li>   <li>Demonstrating of at least 2 bio-based products, showing favourable competition with their fossil-based counterparts with respect to cost-competitiveness, sustainability and performance.</li>  <li>Improving process parameters (e.g. conversion, yield) as compared to currently available processes.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><em>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1.
