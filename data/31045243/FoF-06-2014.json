It offers a solution leading to higher profitability to robot-reluctant industries where current tasks and processes are too complex to be automated. Currently novel methods for human-robot interaction have been proven in structured non-industrial environments. In order to enhance the introduction of robots on the shop floor in a real industrial setting, several important human and organisational issues, such as safety and difficult working environments, have to be dealt with.</p><p>In particular, future human-robot-systems will have to be dynamic and cost-effective, act safely in a shared fenceless working space and allow for the development of specific competences and skills for workers in their interactions with robots. </p><p><u>Scope:</u> While the focus will be on demonstrating the multimodal manufacturing systems (e.g. systems combining visual, auditory and haptic interfaces), R&D activities supporting integration and scale-up are also expected.</p><p>Two key obstacles to overcome to facilitate the introduction of robots on the shop floor of robot resistant production plants are the safety of the worker and the symbiotic collaboration.</p><p>Demonstration activities should focus on at least two topics of each of the two areas:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safety of the worker:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Innovative strategies for online safety monitoring such as the interactive perception of the whole workspace as well as directed perception focused on the task.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of intrinsically safe robot hardware on industrial scale leading to high power robots which are both safe and precise. </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Safety during a mechanical failure of the robotic system during tight collaboration of humans and robots.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Human-Robot interaction:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intuitive and multimodal programming to allow robot systems to be rapidly and easily programmed without prior knowledge on robot systems, while still allowing for a cost-efficient deployment of the robotic system in an industrial setting.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New methodologies for the initial planning and online dynamic replanning of the shared tasks, taking into account the organisation contexts of the addressed industrial sectors.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New innovative, fast and cost-effective sensors for detection in combination with the application of innovative strategies to analyse real-time large amounts of sensor data. </p><p>In close interaction with the research activities, relevant certification issues should be addressed. In order to allow a wide use of the newly developed robotic system in new production areas and sectors, a clear case for maintaining reduced investment costs has to be made, including a return-on-investment study.</p><p>For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project. </p><p>Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1].\u00a0 The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding.
