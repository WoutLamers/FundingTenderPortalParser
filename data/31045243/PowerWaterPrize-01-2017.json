Energy harvesting technologies offer a promising solution, especially in cases where the hard-to-reach and risky location, the small size and the number of the devices required make traditional technologies impractical. Another significant challenge is in developing solutions that are able to optimise energy storage to last for the expected lifetime of the device.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>It is expected to provide the EU water utilities (and/or the municipalities) with an ICT prototype for monitoring of water. The ICT prototype should be based on wireless sensor networks with energy harvesting technologies. Specifically, it is expected to stimulate the creation of an effective and scalable autonomous, zero-power wireless sensor network platform to monitor of water resources.</p><p>The prize is open in terms parameters to be monitored, but as a minimum, the proposed solution should enable the water utilities to monitor in real time the supply and demand of water resources, including leakage management.</p><p>The wireless sensor network should be based on energy-autonomous sensor nodes capable of acquiring, monitoring and eventually analysing and cooperatively communicating their data through the network to a main location.</p><p>Each energy-autonomous wireless sensor node should be composed of an energy harvesting unit to scavenge energy from the surrounding environment; a power management unit responsible for storing and regulating the voltage/current values required for either supplying the other units directly and/or charging a backup battery; wireless transmission unit to transmit this information to a central base station that operates as a central information node.</p><p>For the purpose of this prize, \u2018energy harvesting technologies\u2019 are defined as technologies capable of capturing energy from a system\u2019s environment and converting it into usable electric power. In addition, it is expected to consider the circuitry required to store and manage the generated power.</p><p>The solution should be based on one, or an innovative combination, of sources of energy available for harvesting: light, radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation, thermal gradients, and motion, including fluid flow.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </strong></span>described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-power-water_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u>. </a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><br />\r\n    </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and exclusion criteria:</span></strong> described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-power-water_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u>.</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><br />\r\n    </em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the application template.<em><span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation and award criteria and procedure:</span></strong> described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-power-water_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u>.&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>&nbsp;Indicative timetable for evaluation and award of prizes:</strong></span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: #000000\">Opening for publication 07 April 2017<br />\r\n    Opening for submission: 19th December 2017<br />\r\n    Closing date for submission: 11 September 2018 at 17:00:00 CET<br />\r\n    Award of the prize 1st Quarter 2019</span><em><span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Application templates and evaluation forms for prizes under this topic:</strong></span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Application template for inducement prizes&nbsp;is available after entering the submission tool below (available during the submission opening from 19 December 2017 to 11 September 2018).<u><br />\r\n    </u>&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Additional provisions:</strong></span> described in the <u><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-power-water_en.pdf\">Rules for Contests</a></u>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong><br />\r\n    The general rules for Prizes</strong></span> are described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-f-prizes_en.pdf \">part F of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Additional documents</span></strong>:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme</a> <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/index_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a></strong> your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;
