Europe needs non-dependent access to critical space technologies, which is a conditio-sine-qua-non for achieving Europe\u2019s strategic objectives. \"Non-dependence\" refers to the possibility for Europe to have free, unrestricted access to any required space technology. Whenever possible multiple (&gt;1) sources for the critical technologies shall be promoted across Europe. Reaching non-dependence in certain technologies will open new markets to our industries and will increase the overall competitiveness of the European Space sector.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research in technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness has been undertaken within the frame of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA Task Force on Critical Technologies for European non-Dependence, launched in 2008.

High level specifications and key requirements can be found in the list of actions for 2015-2017.</p><p>Proposals should include a work package dedicated to the development of a commercial evaluation of the technology, and should address how to access the commercial market with a full range (preload) of recurring products.</p><p>A maximum of one proposal per identified priority technology line will be selected for funding.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Reduce the dependence on critical technologies and capabilities from outside Europe for future space applications, as identified in the list of Actions for 2015/2017 as part of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA task force on Critical Technologies;</li>  <li>Develop, or regain in the mid-term, the European capacity to operate independently in space, e.g. by developing in a timely manner reliable and affordable space technologies that in some cases may already exist outside Europe or in European terrestrial applications;</li>  <li>Enhance the technical capabilities and overall competitiveness of European space industry satellite vendors on the worldwide market;</li>  <li>Open new competition opportunities for European manufacturers by reducing the dependency on export restricted technologies that are of strategic importance to future European space efforts;</li>  <li>Enable the European industry to get non-restricted access to high performance technologies that will allow increasing its competitiveness and expertise in the space domain;</li>  <li>Improve the overall European space technology landscape and complement the activities of European and national space programmes;</li>  <li>Greater industrial relevance of research actions and output as demonstrated by deeper involvement of industry, including SMEs, and stronger take-up of research results;</li>  <li>Fostering links between academia and industry, accelerating and broadening technology transfer.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Excerpt from \"Critical Space Technologies for European Strategic Non-Dependence \u2013 Actions for 2015/2017\" (<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/research/horizon-2020\">http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/research/horizon-2020</a>)</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work <span style=\"color: #000000\">Programme, with the following exceptions: considering the nature and objectives of the action, and in view of favouring wider competition and participation, the European Space Agency will not participate in consortia of proposals submitted under this call for proposals.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;

The overarching objective is to contribute at European level, in conjunction with Member States and ESA, to the safeguarding and further development of a competitive and entrepreneurial space industry (including SMEs) and the strengthening of European non-dependence in space systems. This implies enabling advances in space technologies and operational concepts from idea to demonstration in representative terrestrial environments and/or in space.</p><p>Attention will be given to some clear trends in space technology development; on the one hand miniaturization on system and subsystem level, as well as in the development of instrumentation. On the other hand the development to generic technologies coming available for a number of different science and application areas. This leads to obvious synergies that should be promoted.</p><p>Competitiveness of European space industry is strongly dependent on performance in a global market, which has a high variability when compared to the institutional market. The ability to react to contract opportunities world-wide with recurring technologies for satellites is a critical success factor, and depends on ready access for integrators to subsystem and equipment capacities in Europe.</p><p>To ensure the competitive advantage, subsystems and/or equipment have to be technologically mature (i.e. at adequate technology readiness level (TRL[[Technology Readiness Levels are defined in part G of the General Annexes. In the specific area of space, further details can be found in the European Space Agency website \"The ESA Science Technology Development Route\": <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/sre-ft/50124-technology-readiness-level/05\">http://sci.esa.int/sre-ft/50124-technology-readiness-level/05</a>.]]), possibly flight proven) and be accompanied by adequate production rates. European focus in future space technologies, beyond the current state of the art, needs to be strengthened along the entire TRL scale: from low TRL key technologies to in-orbit demonstration and validation. Concrete support for IOD/IOV opportunities is planned for subsequent work programmes (2018-2020), considering previous results and evolving European priorities.</p><p>Technologies for satellite communication will be supported in particular in topics COMPET-2-2016 \"Maturing satellite communication technologies\" and in COMPET-3-2017 \"High data rate chain\". In addition, the topics COMPET-1-2016/2017 \"Technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness\" and COMPET-3-2016 \"In-space electrical propulsion and station keeping\" address important objectives for the satellite communication industry.</p><p>Technologies for Earth observation will supported in particular in topics COMPET-2-2017 \"Competitiveness in Earth observation mission technologies\" and COMPET-3-2017 \"High speed data chain\". In addition, the topics COMPET-1-2016/2017 \"Technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness\" also contribute to enabling technologies for Earth observation.</p><p>Technologies for satellite navigation are addressed in the Galileo part of the work programme.</p><p>Technologies enabling recurrence of use contribute to enhancing industrial competitiveness. Research on modular, reusable elements is therefore encouraged. Standardisation of such modular components by existing initiatives such as the European Space Components Coordination (ESCC) and the European Cooperation for Space Standardisation (ECSS), and their interfaces across Europe can optimise the investments and when applied appropriately facilitate access to emerging commercial markets. Synergies with ongoing work with ESA and Member States in the area of technology standardisation will be sought.</p><p><em><strong>Strategic research clusters</strong></em></p><p>In the frame of Horizon 2020 work programme 2014, two strategic research clusters (SRC) were initiated in the fields of <em>In-Space electrical propulsion and station keeping</em> and <em>Space Robotics Technologies \u2013</em> with two coordination and support actions[[EPIC for In-Space electrical propulsion and station keeping and PERASPERA for Space Robotics Technologies]] awarded having as main objective to oversee and prepare European roadmaps for each SRC.</p><p>Subsequently, this work programme dedicates two SRC topics which are in line with the information contained in the aforementioned roadmaps. Additional topics are planned to follow in the years 2018-2020.</p><p>Regarding the cluster \"Space Robotics Technologies\" applicants may also wish to refer to the ICT part of the work programme on <em>Robotics and Autonomous systems</em>[[<em>Topics from ICT-05-01 to ICT-05-07.</em>]] where generic robotic technologies are addressed.</p><p>Within each SRC the beneficiaries of each awarded grant will collaborate for the purposes of the cluster with the beneficiaries of the other awarded grants.</p><p>Applicants to both SRC topics are advised to consult the corresponding guidelines[[<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/research/horizon-2020\">http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/space/research/horizon-2020</a>]].</p><p><em><strong>Space exploration and science </strong></em></p><p>Europe has, over the years, established a leading position in space exploration and space sciences. The proposed approach is to enable European communities to make a concerted effort to capitalise on current European space sciences, as well as space and planetary exploration infrastructures, and to achieve the highest possible science return from operational and future space missions. Activities which further science in the context of space missions, i.e. supporting scientific instrumentation in support of future or operational missions, will be supported.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 29, 2016 1:51:51 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 29, 2016 1:51:51 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the tab &quot;Topic conditions and documents&quot; (Additional documents)&nbsp;in each topic section.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 4, 2016 9:46:39 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 4, 2016 9:46:39 AM", "content": "<p>A total of <strong>103 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is shown below:<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET-1-2016: 21 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET -2-2016: 23 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET -3-2016-a: 3 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET-3-2016-b: 18 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET-4-2016: 15 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; COMPET-5-2016: 23 proposals<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The evaluation of the proposals, including an ethics screening, is planned to start on the 11th of April and will be closed on the 20th of June 2016.
