Technological progresses in this area that could allow measuring properties of process streams and final products, accurately and in real-time could represent a major step forward towards more reliable and sustainable industrial operations. These real time process data (e.g. chemical composition or biological contamination data) could allow the implementation of \u201cnear real time\u201d closed-loop process control concepts making it possible to operate industrial processes at their optimum both economically and ecologically while ensuring high level of safety.. To obtain real time process data, the development of reliable fast inline measurements will be fundamental. These measurements can easily be integrated into closed loop process control concepts, thus delivering the highest value and near real time process control for industrial operations and decision-making support tools, facilitated, for instance, by integrated databases covering measurements and computational data. The development of these new \u201cnear real time\u201d integrated process control methods is particularly important considering the recently introduced intensified or modularised production concepts, e.g. presenting smaller continuously operated pieces of equipment or integration of process steps that pose new challenges for process analytics in terms of size and speed of analysis.</p><p><u>Scope:</u></p><p>New technologies suitable for \u201cnear real time\u201d integrated process control are expected to introduce significant novelties with respect to sensor technologies, data treatment and data mining, in particular:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision of dynamic information about product properties, stream characteristics and process conditions.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provision of spatially resolved process data. </p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data management for processes optimisation.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sensors for intensified process technology.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fast inline measurements (instead of extractive ones).</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Robustness and reliability insuring minimum operation and maintenance costs. </p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should address several aspects which are considered of major importance in this area; such as:</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cross-sectorial application of process analyser technology (PAT) and product measurement techniques (PPMT) in closed-loop process control capable of inline measurements.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Integration methodologies within a large number of production conditions.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swarm sensors.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Development of new soft-sensors and sensing concepts and models for improved process control using PAT data for the measurement of properties and quality of process streams and final products.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Miniaturised PAT- and PPMT-based advanced control for intensified processes.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disposable sensors in batch and in continuous processes.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control strategies for flexible processes or disposable sensors using integrated and validated PAT data.</p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Process and Product life cycle management.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to demonstrate the proposed technologies and control systems in relevant industrial environments, to prove their technical feasibility and economic viability.</p><p>For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.</p><p>Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 3-5.
