10 MW). This is a way to meaningfully reduce harmful emissions like GHG (through improved energy efficiency of using natural gas and utilization of renewable fuels including biogas and/or green hydrogen) and emissions of NOx, SOx and PM (particles) and also to assure the security of power supply (through decentralized power production).</p><p>The realization of large scale demonstration projects are needed to build up confidence/acceptance of the various stakeholders (electricity/heat producers, public, politicians, investors etc.) and applications to reduce the market entry barriers and to commercialize the technology. These demonstration projects are needed for confidence building to trigger volume scale up with large scale orders. This leads to higher installed capacity and therefore to lower cost. </p><p>The main focus of this area would be in reduction of use of primary energy by efficient and direct conversion of chemical energy (hydrogen, biogas, natural gas and other hydrocarbons, power to gas, industrial waste gases etc.) into power in a decentralized power production to reduce losses due to transmission and distribution.</p><p>In order to increase competitiveness against standard CHP there is a goal to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO in \u20ac/kWh) in the direction of grid costs and competitive total costs of energy in different applications.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 Deploy example FC solutions in commercial or industrial market segments through strong partnerships between end users,
