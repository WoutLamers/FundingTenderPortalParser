The researchers in Europe are constantly challenging the science and improving the technology thereby creating the conditions for innovation, much of which can be exploited in other science and industrial sectors for the benefit of European society. A fundamental basis of the Euratom Programme complementing Horizon 2020 is to support innovation. In this context the researcher plays a critical role. This prize is being offered to highlight and reward the excellence in innovation that can be found in the fusion research programme as well as the quality of the researchers and industries involved. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Scope: </em>There are no specific categories for this prize. The participant(s) is free to submit an application concerning any physics or technology innovation that has been or is being developed in the European fusion research programme and that has a market potential or has been taken up (or recognised) by industry to be further developed for the market. The Jury evaluating submissions will consist of a group of independent experts appointed by the Commission knowledgeable in innovative processes and technology transfer from business and academia. The Jury will submit to the Commission the selected 1st, 2nd and 3rd placed winners who will receive 15,000, 10,000 and 5,000 Euros respectively. The winners will be announced at the SOFT conference in September 2014. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Expected impact: </em>By awarding the \u2018European Prize for Innovation in fusion research\u2019 the Commission will showcase innovations in this research sector and give visibility to the most dynamic, forward-looking and innovative researchers, research teams or industrial participants. This visibility will provide the greater potential for valorisation with the subsequent rewards that this brings to the EU both economically and socially. Furthermore, presenting these awards will stimulate the research community to develop a stronger innovation and entrepreneur culture in the European fusion programme. </p><p>\u00a0</p><p><em>Type of action: </em>The form of funding will be through prizes to a total value of EUR 0.030 million.</p><p>The form of funding will be through prizes to a total value of EUR 0.030 million. </p>\n", "supportInfo": "<div>\r\n<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html\">National Contact Points (NCP)</a></span></strong><span> &ndash; contact your NCP for further assistance.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://een.ec.europa.eu/\"><strong>Enterprise Europe Network</strong></a> &ndash; contact your EEN national contact point for advice to businesses with special focus on SMEs.
