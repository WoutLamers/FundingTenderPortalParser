However, to assess total environmental impacts, real world behaviours and interactions beyond pure propulsion should be evaluated and optimised. This is particularly relevant for plug-in hybridised systems, where the discontinuous nature of operation and the possibility that users don't charge the battery poses significant problems in both the reduction and the assessment of emissions in real driving conditions. In addition, the possibility of converting engine waste heat to useful power or for vehicle functions such as heating or cooling can deliver improvements in energy efficiency but adds significant complexity to these issues. Innovative energy generators, specifically developed for hybrid applications can provide benefits in terms of energy efficiency, cost, size and weight in comparison with derivatives of existing engines as currently implemented in PHEVs. The challenge will be to optimise in real time which form of energy should be used under a range of specific conditions and what new in-engine or after-treatment approaches can be used to holistically minimise real world emissions of both greenhouse and toxic substances. </p><p>Proposed solutions should reach at least TRL7 at the end of the project.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals will have to address all the following technical areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Advanced energy generators in hybrid electric applications (excluding therefore simple derivatives of existing engines) to minimise total environmental impacts.</li><li>Evaluation and optimisation of related hybrid driveline technologies and topologies matching the characteristics of the innovative systems if these are significantly different from current implementations, based on real world operation.</li><li>Holistic management and optimisation of thermal functions of vehicles and systems in both battery- and engine-based operation. This includes battery thermal management, passenger comfort and safety functions (like demisting/defrosting) and real-world operation of after-treatment. The latter, for instance, could be achieved by storing and using available heat or electric energy to improve catalysts efficiency by maintaining them close to or above light-off temperature. Heat to power technologies that convert waste heat into electricity or useful work for driveline and ancillary systems can also be researched if a sufficient energy availability and cost-effectiveness can be proven.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\"><li>Each developed technology should be implemented in an existing demonstrators vehicle (no vehicle or hybrid powertrain development is foreseen except as mentioned above for innovative technologies for which this is impossible) and independently tested in real driving conditions according to the methodologies developed for PHEVs in RDE regulation, with the following more stringent requirements:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>15% higher V x a<sub>pos</sub> values in urban, extraurban and motorway real driving segments;</li><li>Use of raw emissions with no weighting;</li><li>A 2000m limit on altitude gain;</li><li>No time limit on 165 km/h maximum test speed.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Engine peak efficiency shall reach at least 47% to guarantee high efficiency also in areas not covered by battery propulsion (particularly in motorway driving).</li><li>A battery consistent with a WLTP range of at least 80km shall be incorporated or its mass simulated for RDE testing, which will however be performed in charge sustaining mode, with a full passenger load.</li><li>The resulting technology shall demonstrate a reduction of the real world environmental impacts of vehicles consistent with the level of ambition defined for the European Commission Horizon Prize for cleanest engine of the future<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> (with a minimum score of 3<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> for each main pollutant PM/PN, NOx and hydrocarbons, and 1 for \u201cother pollutants\u201d i.e. ammonia, formaldehyde, nitrous oxides and carbon oxide) thus simulating compliance with possible future regulation and ensuring a low impact also when running on the combustion engine.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs)</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EGVI</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-future-engine_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-future-engine_en.pdf</a>, taking in the tables for each pollutant the higher value leading to the indicated score: for instance, a score of 1 for CO means \u2264 400 mg/km</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>The reference document is under review and therefore please check if these values need to be updated correspondingly</p>", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>1.

Awareness of the ever growing impact of noxious and particulate emissions on health and significant progress in battery technology and production will lead to an acceleration of their market penetration. In addition to the specific call on <strong>'Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: Next\u2013Generation Batteries\u2019 </strong>which will address issues related to the necessary advances in electric batteries, the present call will focus on other critical aspects supporting a massive introduction of electrified vehicles: 1) new architectures, concepts and components to support the advent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of electrified vehicles, 2) improve the recharging experience from the view-point of the end-users, 3) supporting the competitiveness of European industries through the development of digitalised production environments and the use of advanced material, 4) addressing the urban dimension of introducing electrified vehicles. This call addresses only road transport.</p><p>As already mentioned, topics addressing issues related to the development of the next generation of electric batteries, which contribute to the EU Battery Alliance, are found in the dedicated cross-cutting Call <strong>'Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: Next\u2013Generation Batteries\u2019 </strong>which is in part 20 \u201cCross-cutting activities\u201d of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020<strong>. </strong>Topics of particular relevance to the \u2018Smart, green and integrated transport\u2019 Challenge in that Call are: LC-BAT-1-2019: Strongly improved, highly performant and safe all solid state batteries for electric vehicles; LC-BAT-5-2019: Research and innovation for advanced Li-ion cells (generation 3b); LC-BAT-6-2019: Li-ion Cell Materials &amp; Transport Modelling; and LC-BAT-7-2019: Network of Li-ion cell pilot lines. Research under these topics will contribute to the creation of a European knowledge and industrial base that will support the development of electromobility applications in transport.</p><p><em>The strategic objective of the Green Vehicles Calls for proposals for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 will be to prepare the ground for this potential massive increase of electrified vehicles and to support European industries to maintain their leading world position in supplying automotive products. The major impact of the research will be to promote the development of a new generation of electric vehicles with a minimum of 400 km range that meets customer expectations, progress and demonstration in urban and regional electric vehicles (light and smart vehicles for passengers, delivery vehicles and buses) and support the production of components and electrified vehicles in Europe. Wide user acceptance shall be stimulated by accessibility and ease of use of all types of charging infrastructure \u2013 public, semi-public and private.</em></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:15:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:15:48 PM", "content": "<p>On 28 April 2020, a total of 70 full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2020 topics:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLC-GV-06-2020 (IA) &ndash; 39 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-07-2020 (IA) &ndash; 2 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-08-2020 (IA) &ndash; 28 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-09-2020 (CSA) &ndash; 1 proposal </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:22:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:22:20 PM", "content": "<p>Reacting to the Covid-19 crisis, the submission deadline for the following topics has been extended to 28 April 2020 17:00:00 Brussels time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLC-GV-06-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-07-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-08-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-09-2020 (CSA)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-08-2020(IA), LC-GV-06-2020(IA), LC-GV-07-2020(IA), LC-GV-09-2020(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:12:20 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:12:20 AM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">On 25 April 2019, a total of 27&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2019 topics:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-03-2019&ndash; 19 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-04-2019&ndash; 3 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-05-2019&ndash; 5 proposals<o:p></o:p></span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-03-2019(IA), LC-GV-05-2019(IA), LC-GV-04-2019(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:52:50 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:52:50 PM", "content": "<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">On 4 April 2018, a total of 34&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2018 topics:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-01-2018 &ndash; 18 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-02-2018 &ndash; 16 proposals&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:21:15 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:21:15 PM", "content": "<div><strong>IMPORTANT - Page limits applicable to proposals:</strong></div>\r\n<div>Applicants are allowed to remove the page break in the cover page of the template for the technical annex, i.e. the proposal text can start on the cover page.</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:34:14 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:34:14 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-01-2018(IA), LC-GV-02-2018(RIA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
