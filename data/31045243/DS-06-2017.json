Research should aim for solutions beyond the current only partial homomorphic encryption algorithms under development.</p><p>Activities should also deal with measurement of information leaked when allowing for flexibility and preserving data formats. Additionally, means to reduce this leakage (e.g., anonymization or obfuscation) should be researched.</p><p>- For application areas such as the Internet of Things, implantable medical devices and sensor nodes that harvest energy from the environment there is a need for ultra-lightweight cryptology. Additional means to protect privacy in these applications (e.g. anonymity in communications) should be developed.</p><p>Even if Moore\u2019s law would hold for the next 10-15 years, the progress in bandwidth and storage capacity grows faster than the computing power; and so this means that there is a need for ultra-high-speed cryptographic algorithms that are fully parallelizable and energy efficient as well as high speed encryption applied directly to the physical layer, for example using quantum cryptography. This challenge is related to the challenge of ultra-lightweight cryptology but the optimization target is very different and hence completely different designs are expected.</p><p>- Implementation (hardware or software) is often the weak point of the strongest cryptographic protocols: physical cryptanalysis, including tampering, side channel, faults injection attacks, has to be taken into account in the early phases of a development. A specific attention should be paid to the security of the implementation and its validation.</p><p>While development tools today include support for good software practices that avoid many common implementation errors, these tools insufficiently support good practices that can bring cyber-secure primitives and applications. Therefore, more progress is needed in the development of toolkits that integrate encryption seamless in their toolbox environment.</p><p>- Authenticated encrypted token research for mobile payment solutions and related applications. Most currently existing payment solutions emulate a credit or debit card payment scheme. Tokenized payment solutions can effectively reduce the risk of cyber-fraud and open options for alternative payment options to European citizens. The proposals should aim to create a real e-currency without compromising security or opening doors for criminals. Different projects may be envisaged, such as an e-\u20ac wallet that can be held on a mobile and used to pay anywhere anytime combining convenience, flexibility and security without compromising the instrument with (inflated) transaction costs or possible criminal misuses.</p><p>- Innovative cryptographic primitives and complementary non-cryptographic privacy-preserving mechanisms to enforce privacy at various levels (e.g. pairing based cryptography).</p><p>- New techniques, such as quantum safe cryptography, which are secure from quantum computers and other advances in computing and cryptanalysis.</p><p>- Proposals on quantum key distribution addressing challenges such as improved performance (higher bit rates, increased loss and noise resilience), network integration (coexistence on existing infrastructure) and the development of new protocols beyond key distribution. Proposals on quantum key distribution should include experimentation and validation with end-users in realistic and relevant scenarios such as for mobile communication backhauling, optical access networks or data-centre to data-centre communication.</p><p>- Automated proof techniques for cryptographic protocols.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 million and EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>The outcome of the proposals is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 to 5;

These challenges are being addressed through innovative approaches that cross the boundaries of individual H2020 pillars, calls and challenges. Therefore the main research &amp; Innovation activities in Digital Security are grouped in a dedicated focus area cutting across LEIT\u2013ICT and Societal Challenges parts of the work programme, including evidently the Societal Challenge 7 on \"Secure Societies\", but also the Societal Challenge 1 on \"Health, demographic change and wellbeing\".</p><p>In July 2016, the European Commission, in partnership with Industry, established the <strong>Cybersecurity contractual Public-Private Partnership (Cybersecurity PPP)</strong>[[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/cybersecurity-industry]]. The Cybersecurity PPP gathers industrial and public resources to deliver innovation against a jointly-agreed roadmap for strategic research and innovation.</p><p>The Cybersecurity PPP will help to align the demand and supply sectors for cybersecurity products while also seeking synergies to develop common, sector-neutral technological building blocks with maximum replication potential e.g. encrypted storage and processing, secured communication, etc.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 16, 2018 4:38:37 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the &lsquo;Additional documents&rsquo; section on the topic pages.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 25, 2017 2:55:41 PM", "content": "<p>A total of 160 proposals have been submitted in response to this call.
