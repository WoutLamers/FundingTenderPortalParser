Such existing cohorts might provide key information relevant to COVID-19, including on risk factors, the benefits and risks of healthcare interventions including medicines and on the impact of vaccination. However, the challenge is to be able to identify and extract a sufficiently high number of cases with corresponding high-quality data that can be used across the different cohorts. Consequently, existing cohorts should be brought together in a common effort to standardize data associated to COVID-19 and extract information that will help ensuring optimal prevention, protection and treatment of citizens.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals under this coordination and support action should support the international networking of existing, mainly longitudinal, cohorts in order to extract jointly agreed standardized data on COVID-19 diagnosed/serotyped and matched non-infected individuals. This effort should contribute to help in the identification of key factors influencing the susceptibility to infection and clinical manifestation, to assess the optimized therapeutic and clinical management options, and to derive lessons on the health and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. They should develop cohort readiness to adapt rapidly to future crisis. Proposals should consider strategies to interact with the COVID-19 cohort(s) that will be funded under this expression of interest and international initiatives on cohorts, as well as liaising with the network of clinical trials on COVID-19.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow these specific challenges to be addressed appropriately.

This expression of interest invites proposals for R&amp;I activities that aim for a wide scale, rapid (in general within 3-24 months) application of health-based solutions to respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account the wide variety of approaches how care is delivered across Europe.</p><p>Proposals should consider the strong involvement of end-users (including civil society organisations) and/or strategic partners during the course of the project. Possible end-users and strategic partners are; local or regional health authorities or other types of care delivery organisations (also in their role as employers), civil society organisations, as well as public and private organisations, such as investors and innovation accelerators.</p><p>Proposals will contribute to making healthcare systems and societies more resilient to pandemics in terms of prevention, protection and treatment of the population and COVID-19 patients. Projects could make significant and immediate impacts in improving the quality of life of the most vulnerable and the, well-being and operational capacity of frontline workers. In addition, this expression of interest encourages proposals to come forward that lead to increasing short term production and distribution capacities and proposals that facilitate new effective approaches for multi-level cooperation between, local, regional Member States and EU-levels. Actions must demonstrate how they bring about a faster, more impactful, cost-effective and larger scale implementation of innovative (technological and non-technological) solutions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Gender-related issues are an important crosscutting focus of this expression of interest. All data should be sex- and gender-disaggregated, and indirect effects of the pandemic on gender equality should also be considered. In addition, attention should be paid to critical social factors intersecting with sex/gender, such as age, social origin, ethnicity/migration, and disability.</p><p>Therefore, the focus of this expression of interest is <strong>not to develop new diagnostics, therapeutics or vaccine compounds or solutions, but rather to complete and deploy readily available solutions</strong>.</p><p>International Cooperation through the participation of legal entities from third countries, and/or regions including those not automatically eligible for funding in accordance with General Annex A, is encouraged in the current call, within the terms of the Rules for Participation and of the mentioned General Annex A.</p>\n<p>All deadlines are at 17.00.00 Brussels local time. Any change in the deadlines will be duly communicated.</p><p>The signature of the grant agreements and the grant amounts are subject to the adoption of the revised financing decision for the year 2020 expected for late May 2020.</p><p>Beneficiaries in grants awarded under actions relating to this Public Health Emergency will be allowed to charge the cost of clinical studies on the basis of unit costs established in line with a methodology set up in the Commission Decision C(2016) 7553, which is available on the Funding and tenders Portal.</p><p>Please note that expenditures can be covered from the date of submission of the proposal, but at the applicant\u2019s own risk.
