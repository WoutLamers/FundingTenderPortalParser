These challenges include improved performance and lower costs of both fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and thereby a strengthened customer acceptance. This requires a large scale \u201cmarket test\u201d with HRS located on a network basis in different regions showing various geographical and demographical characteristics; and with sufficient vehicle numbers, and types, per station to generate relevant data based on demonstration of the HRS under high load conditions. The learnings obtained are specifically intended to trigger further technological improvements of both stations and vehicles and to provide the necessary experience and confidence on the part of investors and policy makers in the business plans for the multi-billion euros of investments needed to establish the HRS infrastructure required for mass market roll-out.</p><p>For the purpose of this topic, it is expected that use of electrolysis integrated into fuelling stations will demonstrate a capability to assist the penetration of renewable power in electricity grids by taking excess electricity and converting it into hydrogen. Concurrently, as FCEV fleets increase, the aggregate electrical load constituted by onsite electrolyser based H2 production coupled with HRS facilities could also provide valuable balancing services to the power industry in addition to strengthening the economic case for decentralized electrolysers. A techno-economic framework and control hierarchy is required to ensure appropriate electrolyser-infrastructure is developed for providing balancing services and sufficient low carbon footprint hydrogen is available for FCEV refuelling. Consideration is required of how to design and operate suitable production and refuelling infrastructure, both for wind-dominated and solar-dominated regions, including how central, regional and forecourt electrolysers are operated within the electricity grid. In this topic the focus is on decentralised electrolysis integrated into fuelling stations.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic calls for a large scale demonstration project covering FCEVs and HRSs, coupled to decentralized electrolysers, to be deployed in alignment with and in cooperation with national or/and regional roll-out activities. Demonstration of electrolyser integrated HRS operating in grid balancing mode in a selection of the new HRS installed will also be covered.</p><p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p>For vehicles, the project will cover the roll-out of a fleet of at least 200 FCEVs. This should comprise multiple OEM supplied passenger cars, utility vehicles (light duty vans, medium duty trucks) and buses. Other vehicles can be included provided they can demonstrate a strong business case a significant market potential (10,000\u2019s per year) and have reached a TRL of 7 or above.</p><p>The majority of FCEV's are expected to be using a fuel cell system as the key power source, and 70MPa storage in the case of passenger cars or 35 MPa for buses. Storage systems lower than 70MPa can be allowed if relevant and there is a business and customer case for inclusion in the proposal. Range extenders using FCs are also eligible if relevant and can show a clear advantage over all-electric drivetrains for the same vehicle type.</p><p>The minimum operation for passenger cars is 36 months or 45,000 km. For buses it should be 36 months in operational service at minimum 10h/day (unless regulatory restrictions prohibit 10h). The minimum operational period for vehicles introduced in the last 15 months of the project is 12 months or 10,000 km for passenger cars and 12 months or 50,000 km for buses, though in both cases arrangements for extending operation after the end of the project are expected.</p><p><strong>HRS</strong></p><p>In this topic, the focus is on demonstrating at least 20 HRS in operation and on investigating the specific problems arising from the need to provide high volumes of hydrogen per day while offering satisfactory service to HRS customers in terms of refuelling duration per vehicle (back to back refuelling performance). It is expected that HRS will prove performance under high load. In addition, proposals are expected to address reliability, metering accuracy, purity and station efficiency.</p><p>When addressing the passenger car market, HRS facilities need to be accessible for private customers/users and should preferably be integrated in forecourts of conventional refuelling stations. When addressing the utility vehicle market or local fleets, HRS facilities might be located on private forecourts, with or without public access, as long as several customers are already identified as long term users of the HRS. The first HRS need to be operational at the latest 24 months after the start of the project. The majority of the HRS have to be operational no later than 36 months after project start. The minimum operation for the HRS is 5 years (operation beyond the project life is expected.</p><p>The project should aim at benchmarking and establishing links between existing regional and national initiatives in order to synchronize actions and maximize impact Europe wide. The demonstration sites for passenger cars, buses, utility vehicles and vans must be located in more than one EU member state where H2 Mobility initiatives, or similar initiatives (like HIT) aiming at deployment of hydrogen based mobility programmes are in place, to leverage the activities already underway. HRS should be sited to provide interconnectivity with existing initiatives to create a plausible driving experience both within and between the networks. In view of the requirement to evaluate HRS under high load, consideration should also be given to locations with a high number of users, addressing both privately owned or fleet vehicles.</p><p>Different options for the ownership and investment in HRS should be analysed and tested.</p><p><strong>On-site hydrogen production &amp; grid support</strong></p><p>The project should demonstrate the use of fluctuating renewable energy sources for hydrogen supplied to the HRS:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Develop a model of the required electrical behaviour of various penetrations of electrolysers and HRS for grid balancing in a range of future scenarios of renewable power penetration and mobility hydrogen demand. The model should provide the most economic favourable scenarios based on a multi-market service strategy</li>  <li>Identify preferred electrolyser and HRS design, including control configurations, for providing the required balancing services and match the local hydrogen demand on the stations and for other applications</li>  <li>Identify operational frameworks (including pooling when needed) for grid operators to utilise electrolysers for balancing services and quantify the associated remuneration. The extent to which electrolysers can assist with meeting energy storage requirements in the EU for the period 2020-2050 should be determined.</li>  <li>Demonstrate cost effective and optimised running strategies for a cluster of electrolysers acting as a single capacity in the energy market. This includes electrolyser load decisions based on electricity cost, electrolyser efficiency at different loads and hydrogen demand at individual stations</li>  <li>The electrolysis technology must demonstrate an electricity consumption below 60 kWh/kgH2 and a capital cost @ rated power including ancillary equipment and commissioning of 6 - 8 M\u20ac / (t/d) for PEM technology and 4 \u2013 6 M\u20ac / (t/d) for alkaline technology</li>  <li>The forecourt electrolysers must demonstrate an optimized integration of the electrolysis with the refuelling station including buffer tanks sizing consistent with the operating modes selected</li> </ul><p>Safety assessment shall include the social acceptance dimension.</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p><p>Measurement, monitoring and evaluation of specific vehicle and fuelling station parameters using methodology such as those used in current projects funded by the FCH JU. The project shall prepare for the use of low-carbon hydrogen and aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the hydrogen refuelled by at least 50% on a well-to wheel basis as compared to new gasoline and diesel vehicles. The results of the CertifHy Project will be taken into account in the analysis of the emissions.</p><p>Ensuring that the knowledge acquired throughout the project will help to provide the confidence to underpin future investment and policy decisions in favour of hydrogen vehicles is of key importance. Therefore priority will be given to proposals presenting a comprehensive programme to gather new learning from the project in terms of: customer acceptance, techniques for the operation of a station network, business models for national HRS roll-out, technology performance (and requirements for improvement, using the HyLights methodology) and the impact of different national policies on roll-out effectiveness.</p><p>A formal, inclusive and creative dissemination programme is required which ensures that the lessons learnt by the project are made available to wider public. In particular, it should be ensured that countries considering development of similar FCEVs/HRS roll-out initiatives should have an easy access to information generated by the consortium.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p>At least 80% of the vehicles to be deployed in the project should be \u201cnext\u201d generation and based on model platforms made available / released in Europe after 1st January 2015).
