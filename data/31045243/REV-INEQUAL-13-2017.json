In the medium and long term, much will depend on how fast and well these new migrants will be integrated into European labour markets. International experience suggests that they have lower employment rates and lower wages than EU workers, but that these differences diminish over time as migrants improve their language skills and gain professional experience in the host country. At the same time, their successful labour market integration could also help alleviate the fiscal effects of negative demographic trends. Nonetheless, the situation of post-2014 refugees and asylum applicants is more complicated since they may face a number of specific barriers to accessing labour markets, including related to xenophobia and discrimination. These obstacles include the loss of identity documentation and education certificates, non-acceptance of qualifications or educational attainment, family separation, long periods of inactivity in the asylum system, lack of educational opportunities, geographical mobility restrictions and discrimination. Initial obstacles and failure to develop efficient integration policies, including at sectorial level, may ultimately lead to chronic underemployment and social exclusion. The specific aim is to examine the challenges and opportunities faced by refugees and asylum applicants in connection with their skills, qualifications, access to education, and employability. The goal is to estimate the economic and social impacts of the policies designed to improve the integration of migrants and to provide policy recommendations for facilitating integration.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research to address this challenge should take stock of skills and qualifications of post-2014 migrants, including asylum seekers and refugees, with a view to estimate the potential for integration. Analysis should provide insights on the reasons behind rates of unemployment and inactivity of international migrants, including at local level. Comparisons with earlier cohorts from similar sending countries should be explored to estimate gaps and challenges, identify transferable practices, and provide better calibrated policy recommendations. Special attention should be given to facilitating the integration of women and young migrants in the labour market through access to education and training.</p><p>Research should also review policies which aim to facilitate the labour market integration of asylum seekers at sectorial level, taking into account sectorial shortages and needs. Comparative explorations (involving multiple Member States and, where relevant, third countries) should cover a wide range of interventions e.g. education and training, recognition of qualifications and skills, access to housing, migration-induced linguistic diversity and its consequences for society, removing legal restrictions to early labour market entry, language skills, active labour market policies, the effectiveness of wage subsidies and entrepreneurial incentives (including access to credit), tax and benefits schemes, and wage levels. In combination with the above, the analysis should also assess barriers to labour market integration specific to post-2014 international migrants and potential avenues for the EU in facilitating access to employment. Finally, the social and economic fallout from social exclusion of the recently arrived international migrants should be explored.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The analytical data sets on skills, qualifications and employability of post-2014 refugees and asylum applicants provided by this research action are meant to inform the design of policies and programmes that facilitate their labour market entry or further training. The identified best practices and benchmarks ought to allow for measuring the effectiveness of pro-active employment policies targeting the specified migrant cohorts across Europe.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

Large disparities in human and social capacities are counterproductive to a sustainable and creative economy and participatory governance and inclusion. They jeopardise economic growth while threatening the very foundations of democracy, the rule of law and respect of human rights in Europe. These questions have to be analysed from a theoretical perspective and practical solutions to overcome inequalities have to be recommended.</p><p>For more inclusive societies to take shape in the medium term, coherent visions will need to be devised on how to foster a social and economic framework that promotes fairness and sustainability in Europe as key policy objectives, while enhancing social dialogue, respecting the continent\u2019s diversity and considering the global context.</p><p>The current migration crisis calls for a better European coordination of research on migration and asylum as well as a cross-national comparative research on migration. Two specific Platforms are envisaged in this call. In addition a research action on employability, skills, and labour market integration of migrants will provide new and policy relevant knowledge on this subject.</p><p>The rise in inequalities in Europe and other parts of the world comprises hitherto unknown quantitative and qualitative dimensions: in the wake of the financial and economic crisis, highly increased levels of inequality (e.g. income and wealth concentration, gender inequality) can be detected alongside novel types of inequalities (e.g. debt inequality, inequality in access to justice or political life, spatial inequality). Options to reverse inequalities should be evidence-based and suggested at EU level.</p><p>These recent trends will need to be fully understood and effectively tackled through comprehensive research and innovation activities. Based on a sound understanding of inequality trends, policies and measures aimed at reversing various kinds of inequalities need to be examined. Different options for policies and measures (e.g. social dialogue, tax policy, new forms of evidence-based education, public service innovation, welfare state reforms, labour market, employment and consumer policies and practices) should be identified and their usefulness be compared. Specific emphasis should be given to the objective of reversing territorial inequalities, equal enjoyment of human rights and the conditions enabling comprehensive urban policies, the mobile provision of social services and an equal access to ICT use.</p><p>Most of the Topics of REV-INEQUAL concern primarily the EU, although a certain number of issues clearly have an international dimension. This is particularly the case for Topic 2 on radicalisation, Topic 4 on mobility, and Topics 11, 12 and 13 on migration. The content of these Topics is linked with the ENG-GLOBALLY call (Topics 1, 3 and 10) and with the Societal Challenge 7 Topic SEC-06-FCT-2016: \u201c<em>Developing a comprehensive approach to violent radicalization in the EU from early understanding to improving protection</em>\u201d. In these Topics the participation of entities from the international partner countries and regions concerned is strongly encouraged.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 7, 2017 2:33:20 PM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: REV-INEQUAL-09-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-12-2017(CSA), REV-INEQUAL-13-2017(RIA), REV-INEQUAL-11-2017(CSA)</p>\r\n<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-REV-INEQUAL-2016-2017<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Thursday 2 of February 17 Pm 2017.
