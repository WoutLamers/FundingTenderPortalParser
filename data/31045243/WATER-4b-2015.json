The same applies for research that gives answers to policy implementation, like achieving good status under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) or good environmental status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and achieving the objectives of other EU water legislation. This is exacerbated by the fact that water research and innovation faces several multidisciplinary challenges and involves a wide variety of policy sectors, decision makers, public and private users and stakeholders at various levels.</p><p>Critical mass is needed for knowledge exchange, to ensure wide applicability of research results, facilitate the translation of knowledge into use by various stakeholders, reduce unnecessary duplication of efforts, raise public awareness of water-related issues and promote innovation and business development.</p><p><u>Scope</u>: </p><p>Proposals should aim to:</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 implement measures to showcase, exchange, test and transfer water management solutions to end-users in the agricultural sector in view of improving water use efficiency and quality in agricultural practices.
