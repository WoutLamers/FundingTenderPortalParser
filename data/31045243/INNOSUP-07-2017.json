In the recent past innovation support agencies recognised that successful innovation is not originating only from scientific research and technological development, but from new business models, the uptake of technologies, design and organisational changes. Furthermore 'internationalisation\u2019 of business activities is seen as a case of business innovation in some countries.</p><p>A better understanding of business innovation opportunities led to an even broader array of innovation support measures put in place for SMEs. But the question arose how to better identify and target those SMEs that can create highest impact from the specific support measures; and how to offer viable alternatives to those enterprises not yet ready to implement the most ambitious projects. Representatives from innovation agencies were describing this process of matching design and delivery of support schemes to the needs, potentials and ambition of their client SMEs as <em>\u2018segmentation of the client base\u2019</em>.</p><p>Processes of value creation from innovation differ between industrial sectors. For example between capital intensive - but low-speed \u2013 innovation in the mining industry; the high speed innovation software development for example for gaming which is realised in networks; pharmaceutical industry with a dominant role of patents and industries with long and complex supply chains like automotive or aerospace.</p><p>Many regions try to identify potential high-growth SMEs and orient their support towards realising their full growth potential, yet the methodologies to identify high potentials vary substantially and innovation support programmes put in place are hardly designed taking account of the economic fabric or of the smart specialisation priorities of the region. Instead often a standard portfolio of innovation support measures is put in place.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The above describes three interwoven aspects of a challenge to segment the (SME-) clients of public innovation support in order to achieve a higher societal return from the investments into innovation support. The action shall contribute to documenting and analysing existing and potential new approaches to provide innovation support in a more effective and efficient way. Successfully segmenting 'innovating SMEs' \u2013 the clients of innovation agencies \u2013 is a key in that respect.</p><p>To address the described gaps proposals should address one or more of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Develop methodologies to identify segments within the group of innovating SMEs (including SMEs that are not yet innovating but have innovation potential or need) and describe portfolios of innovation support measures that typically address well their needs along innovation cycles. To that end the proposed project should rely on existing datasets (Community Innovation Survey [CIS] or others) or conduct own targeted surveys.</li>  <li>Analyse existing approaches to segment innovating SMEs and analyse existing portfolios of innovation support measures in how far they respond to the needs of important segments in the region.</li>  <li>Analyse in how far popular innovation support instruments like tax credits, vouchers, grants are biased towards certain innovating SMEs or provide opportunities to overcome existing biases.</li> </ul><p>Projects to be supported are encouraged to conduct specific communication activities targeting the relevant associations of regional development agencies and innovation support agencies.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.30 and 1.00 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The result of the research action shall strengthen the capacity of national and regional ministries, innovation agencies and providers of innovation support, such as cluster organisations, science and technology parks or development agencies, to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>better understand the patterns of innovation opportunities and activities in different segments of the SMEs according to age, size, business activity, industry sector, organisational features and other relevant aspects;</li>  <li>better understand the impact of specific types of innovation support with low entry requirements on different segments of the SME population \u2013 of particular interest in this context are tax credits for RDI expenditure, voucher and small grant schemes to strengthen management capacity and technology uptake; </li>  <li>target existing measures better to those SMEs that can create highest economic and societal impact;</li>  <li>design new measures for specific segments of the SMEs to start or diversify innovation activities which create highest impact for their competiveness.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"> </span><br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;

A strong rationale exists for public support to SMEs\u2019 innovation activities in order to overcome market failures specific to SMEs and to fully realise their growth potential. The public supports \u2018SME innovation\u2019 with grants, subsidised loans, equity and a wide range of innovation support services. However, SMEs receiving innovation support often remain dissatisfied with the services they receive; while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided. The nature of innovation is changing: open data, open software, open hardware design and crowd-funding make it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources \u2013 but the challenge arises from scaling these initial offerings to create growth and jobs. Social innovation is required at the interface between public services and private enterprise to maintain the high standard and security of living in Europe. While small enterprises face challenges in recruiting talent - among others as a result of increased mobility \u2013 researchers have problems pursuing academic careers and work below their qualifications.</p><p>As the nature and environment for innovation changes the public innovation support has not only to follow those developments but also become proactive in shaping them.</p><p>The following call for proposal is one element of a broader action to develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Where appropriate, a highly specialised support service may be established at European level to complement existing national and regional services. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, peer-learning and uptake of new approaches. In the work programme 2016-17 emphasis is put on testing three new approaches to a better innovation support in large pilot actions that should deliver results in time for the start of discussion on the next framework programme for research and innovation. The Enterprise Europe Network, present in all European regions and co-financed by them, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to play an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (4th April 2017- 17:00:00), a total of 73 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2016-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-03-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-07-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "content": "<p>H2020-INNOSUP-02-2016 SME Innovation Associate - at the closing&nbsp;date (30&nbsp;June 2016 17:00:00 BLT), a total of 192 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (6 April 2016 17:00:00), a total of 97 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>INNOSUP-02-2016- SME Innovation Associate: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate-essential-tips-your-application\">essential tips to applicants </a>were published.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-02-2016(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-02-2016: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/h2020-sme-_innovation-associate-presentation.pdf\">Additional Information for Applicants </a>are published on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate\">H2020 SME Innovation Associate webpage </a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-04-2016(CSA-CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-05-2016-2017(CSA-CSA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
