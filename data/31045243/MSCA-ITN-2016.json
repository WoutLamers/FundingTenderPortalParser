It will provide enhanced career perspectives in both the academic and non-academic sectors through international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility combined with an innovation-oriented mind-set.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>ITN supports competitively selected joint research training and/or doctoral programmes, implemented by partnerships of universities, research institutions, research infrastructures, businesses, SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond.</p><p>Partnerships take the form of collaborative European Training Networks (ETN), European Industrial Doctorates (EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD).</p><p>Each programme should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training and establishing active and continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the partners to maximise the benefits of the partnership.</p><p>The programme should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations, and enable sharing of knowledge, networking activities, the organisation of workshops and conferences.</p><p>Training responds to well identified needs in defined research areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follows the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/pdf/research_policies/Principles_for_Innovative_Doctoral_Training.pdf\">EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training</a>. It should be primarily focused on scientific and technological knowledge through research on individual, personalised projects.</p><p>In order to increase the employability of the researchers, the research training should be complemented by the meaningful exposure of each researcher to the non-academic sector.</p><p>Secondments of the researcher to other beneficiaries and partner organisations are encouraged.</p><p>Substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship will be supported.</p><p>In order to reflect on the changing nature of research, training should prepare early-stage researchers for an increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, open access, raw data, etc.).</p><p>A Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the early-stage researcher recruited by the selected network. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including planning for publications and participation in conferences.</p><p>Attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for EJD and for EID, and encouraged in ETN. In EID, the joint supervision of the researcher must be ensured by at least one supervisor from the academic sector and one supervisor from the non-academic sector. These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal.</p><p>In EID and EJD, fellowships offered to early-stage researchers should lead to a doctoral degree. EJD result in joint<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>, double or multiple doctoral degrees<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> awarded by institutions from at least two different countries.</p><p>In EID and EJD, enrolment in a doctoral programme and the creation of a joint governance structure - with joint admission (EJD only), selection, supervision, monitoring and assessment procedures - is mandatory. These arrangements will be taken into account during the evaluation of the proposal.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>At researcher level:</p><ul level=\"0\">
