It holds the promise to help address many of the major challenges of today's transport system, such as user safety, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, air quality and congestion, and to enhance the drivers' individual comfort and convenience. At the same time, it represents a critical testing ground for the ability of the European automotive industry to preserve and consolidate its global leadership. Automakers around the world are unanimous in predicting the emergence of systems for automated driving sometime in the near future.</p><p>Current technology will evolve further towards semi-automation and eventually towards full automation in real moving traffic. This evolution is very promising and may help to drastically reduce road fatalities to near zero, as more than 90% of road accidents are partly or fully due to human errors. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges related to technology, digital infrastructure, user and societal acceptance, driver behaviour, regulation and legislation, and business models, which need to be tackled to enable the deployment of automated driving on European roads.</p><p>The main contribution of this call will be to support the short term introduction of passenger cars automated driving level 3 (Conditional Automation - Full driving performed by an automated driving system with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene in real traffic conditions)[[The SAE International's standard J3016 identifies six levels of driving automation from \"no automation\" to \"full automation\"]] including safe stops, and of truck platooning in real traffic conditions from 2020 onwards. The main focus of this call is on demonstrations of automated driving systems for passenger cars, trucks and urban transport. Demonstrations will be complemented by further research on digital infrastructure to ensure the necessary level of safety, reliability and efficiency of automated driving systems and by a comprehensive analysis of safety aspects in relation to mixed traffic conditions and their influence on end user acceptance. This call includes also an action to assess road infrastructure requirements for higher levels of vehicle automation and to coordinate and support all research and innovation activities on automated driving both at European and international levels.</p><p>Cooperative systems and connectivity, based on communication of real-time vehicle data, as important means to increase the performance of automated driving will also be addressed in other calls, such as Mobility for Growth (topic MG-6.2-2016 on 'Large-scale demonstration(s) of cooperative ITS'). There is considerable complementarity between the development and deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems and that of Automated Road Transport. ICT components e.g. sensors and microsystems and data fusion which are important elements of automated road transport will be addressed in the LEIT/ICT Work Programme, as well as in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. The 'Internet of Things' call [Work Programme Part Cross-cutting activities (Focus Areas) \u2013 Annex 20] addresses a pilot on 'Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment' which focuses on technology research in a broader IoT context, including horizontal elements such as ethics and privacy, trust and security, validation, standards and interoperability, user acceptability and human factor, liability and sustainability. There is also complementarity with the LEIT/Space Work Programme part, in particular with the call 'Applications in Satellite Navigation \u2013 Galileo', topic 'Galileo-1-2017 \u2013 EGNSS Transport'.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "content": "<p>On 27 September 2017 a total of 7 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2017 two-stage topics (Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the Generalised Feedback for the first stage of 2017 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "content": "<p><br />\r\nOn 26 January 2017 a total of 22 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;14 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;6 proposals</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "content": "<p>On 29 September 2016 a total of 11 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nART-02-2016 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-04-2016 &ndash; 4 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 &ndash; 6 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-07-2017(IA), ART-01-2017(IA), ART-03-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2016 two-stage topics <strong>(Flash Call Info)</strong> can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the <strong>Generalised Feedback</strong> for the first stage of 2016 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Previous updates:</strong></p>\r\n<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "content": "<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-04-2016(RIA), ART-05-2016(RIA), ART-02-2016(IA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
