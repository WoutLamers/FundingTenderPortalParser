This is due to low production volume, proprietary system design, component concepts which are not suitable for mass production and the non-existence of a competitive supplier market.</p><p>While in the field of hydrogen infrastructure and supply standardisation activities are in a more advanced state, on the on board storage component level the variety of component designs is still very high. Such components are for example the pressure vessel, the on-tank valve, the Pressure Regulation Devices, the pressure regulator, hydrogen pressure and temperature sensors, the fittings and the seals of the high pressure lines.</p><p>From a customer\u2019s point of view these components do not lead to a competitive advantage of one vehicle manufacturer over another as long as the system works within its specification.</p><p>A standardisation of systems, processes and components is therefore an efficient means to accelerate market introduction of automotive hydrogen storage technology including qualification of a capable supplier base. Standardisation of hydrogen storage components will lead to generally agreed interfaces and specifications and ultimately to higher production volumes of such components.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 The hydrogen storage technologies that are closest to the market are currently the 70 MPa compressed hydrogen storage for passenger cars and 35 MPa compressed hydrogen storage for vans and heavy duty vehicles. New storage concepts (cryo-compressed hydrogen storage at 30 MPa) are considered within the scope of this topic, provided that these fulfil all requirements for automotive applications.
