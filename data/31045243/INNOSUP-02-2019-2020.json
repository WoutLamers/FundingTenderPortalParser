Individual SMEs are at a disadvantage to recruit specialised knowledge as they often lack Europe-wide networking connections and do not tend to have established brands as large enterprises. Enterprise-led mobility programmes, supporting enterprises in recruiting expertise, show a high level of satisfaction and return on investment. This methodology is not currently used at European level and this enterprise-led approach is to be further developed and tested, using the first experiences of this pilot action financed by the work programme 2016-2017. This action complements Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie actions (MSCA) which focus on developing research careers, by providing additional work opportunities for experienced researchers in innovating SMEs.</p><p>This action is a continuation of the pilot action, which is part of the Innovation in SMEs work programme 2016-2017. The first \"innovation associates\" supported by the 2016-2017 pilot started working in SMEs as of September 2017 onwards. The detailed provisions and the conditions of the action in 2019-2020 are therefore subject to revision based on the conclusions from the first pilot, including also the findings of the accompanying study to INNOSUP-02-2016 that is conducted in parallel to INNOSUP-02-2016.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This SME-led pilot is an innovation capacity building action to provide a grant at European level to visionary<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> SMEs that can demonstrate that the skills required for a particular innovation idea are not within reach for them at national level (for example because the required skills are not available or not affordable for SMEs). SMEs are supported to employ a highly skilled experienced researcher (referred to as an 'innovation associate') for a continuous period of one year. The innovation associate's task will be to explore, during the course of his/her contract, the potential of their innovative idea and turn it into an innovation project.</p><p>The evaluation of proposals will focus on the demonstrated benefits of recruiting transnationally i.e. the impact for the SME to get access to skills not available on the national labour market; the excellence and impact of the innovative idea, as well as the coherence and effectiveness of the recruitment plan, which should offer the same opportunities for male/female candidates.</p><p>SMEs that will receive a grant will be obliged to advertise their vacancy on EURAXESS, unless a contract with an innovation associate has already been signed in line with the provisions above. They are also encouraged to publish the vacancy notice on any other relevant platform or media, with a clear indication that the grant was awarded.</p><p>SMEs that are awarded a grant are obliged to employ an \"innovation associate\" for a continuous period of one year<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. The innovation associate's tasks shall be to identify the potential of the company's innovation idea with the objective and turn it into an innovation project and - hopefully - a continuation of the employment of the innovation associate. During the period covered by the grant, the Innovation Associate must work exclusively on the project described in the grant agreement.</p><p>During these 12 months of employment, every associate is requested to participate in a core training programme on industrial innovation and business management<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. Also during that period, SMEs get financial support to implement a training and development plan specifically for the associate, tailored to the needs of the associate and the enterprise to make the associate fully operational in the company. Proposals shall outline how the proposed tailored training contributes to this end and why it is necessary within the context of the innovation idea and the tasks of the innovation associate.</p><p>In line with the orientation of the action and with the aim to accelerate the integration of the associate in the company's staff, the following costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the grant:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Personnel costs of the associate.</li><li>Relocation costs of the associate, which may include removal cost, travel cost of the associate and his/her immediate family (if applicable) to the new place of employment, visa cost (if applicable), translation cost of certificates (if applicable), a temporary transition allowance to cover extra costs upon arrival in the place of employment, cost for the relocation in the country of origin after the project, as well as other clearly justified expenditure directly related to relocation.</li><li>Travel and subsistence costs of the associate to the core training programme and travel and subsistence for tailored training (as described in the personal development plan). Travel cost and subsistence for the supervisor may be eligible for up to two training sessions.</li><li>Travel and subsistence cost for the innovation associate and the supervisor in the enterprise to one kick-off meeting in Brussels (one day), organised by the European Commission<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>.</li><li>External cost for the tailored training of the associate (for example course fees or other cost required to implement the training and development plan). Activities that fall under normal induction training<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> for any new employee in a company will not be eligible under this call.</li> </ul><p>Personnel cost may include allowances that are in line with the beneficiary\u2019s standard practices (for example child education or housing allowances).</p><p>Other costs like recruitment costs, equipment costs or travel costs to action-specific workshops by the supervisor in the enterprise are covered by the flat rate indirect cost.</p><p>Any cost not directly related to the employment and training of the innovation associate - for example cost of research, dissemination or promotion activities and other cost relating to the actual implementation of the innovation idea/project - are not eligible under this call.</p><p>For the call in 2020, please note that this topic will take the form of lump sums as defined in Commission Decision C(2017)7151 of 27 October 2017<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup>. Details of the lump sum funding pilot scheme are published on the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup> together with the specific Model Grant Agreement for Lump Sums<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup> applicable.</p><p>It is intended to support an indicative total number of 80-100 assignments from the indicative budget.

Technological advances are making it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources - but SMEs often struggle to scale up and create new jobs, including recruiting talent.</p><p>There is a wide range of public sector support through grants, subsidised loans, equity, and innovation support services. Yet SMEs are often dissatisfied with these, while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided.</p><p>The following call for proposals is one element of a broader action to address these challenges and develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, and peer-learning. The emphasis is on further testing new approaches for better innovation support, such as blockchain technologies, workplace innovation, a network for Open Innovation, training on advanced manufacturing, experimentation in innovation agencies and a tool for investors in financing SMEs. These large pilot actions will consolidate the results and provide recommendations for the preparation of the next framework programme.
