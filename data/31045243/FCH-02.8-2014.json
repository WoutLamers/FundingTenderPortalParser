Also electrolysers can provide services such as load response management to evolving electricity grids. </p><p>Current systems are designed for high efficiency at their operating design point, at typically close to 100% load, and to run continuously. Providing energy services is expected to require start-stop and dynamic operation and high efficiency across much of the load curve. While a number of electrolyser operating strategies can be used to help balance supply and demand, the electrolyser manufacturing industry is still rather uncertain as to which of the requirements will ultimately provide financial income in a future energy market.</p><p>Moreover, in order to compete with central steam methane reforming as hydrogen source, electrolysers must both benefit from very low electricity prices as a result of higher volatility, but even more important, to reduce capital cost to a fraction of the current figures, namely -30% in 2020. Proper design of next electrolyser systems, to be commercially available no later than 2020, must focus in developments both in stack design as well as in the balance of plant components and system engineering.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 Proposals should address the following developments:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Identification of the performance specifications required to provide grid services in a broad sense, as potential income sources for an electrolyser operator.
