Research is needed to assess how to mostly benefit from the AI based technologies in enhancing EU\u2019s resilience against newly emerging security threats (both \u201cclassical\u201d and new AI supported) and in reinforcing the capacity of the Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) at national and at EU level to identify and successfully counter those threats. In addition, in security research, data quality, integrity, quantity, availability, origin, storage and other related challenges are critical, especially in the EU-wide context. To this end, a complex set of coordinated developments is required, by different actors, at the legislative, technology and Law Enforcement levels. For AI made in Europe, three key principles are: \"interoperability\", \u201csecurity by design\u201d and \u201cethics by design\u201d. Therefore, potential ethical and legal implications have to be adequately addressed so that developed AI systems are trustworthy, accountable, responsible and transparent, in accordance with existing ethical frameworks and guidelines that are compatible with the EU principles and regulations.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals under this topic should aim at exploring use of AI in the security dimension at and beyond the state-of-the-art, and exploiting its potential to support LEAs in their effective operational cooperation and in the investigation of traditional forms of crime where digital content plays a key role, as well as of cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. On the one hand, as indicated in \u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2013 A European Perspective\u201d, AI systems are being and will increasingly be used by cyber criminals, so research into their capabilities and weaknesses will play a crucial part in defending against such malicious usage. On the other hand, Law Enforcement will increasingly engage in active usage of AI systems to reinforce investigative capabilities, to strengthen digital evidence-making in court and to cooperate effectively with relevant LEAs. Consequently, proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>develop AI tools and solutions in support of LEAs daily work. This should include combined hardware and software solutions such as robotics or Natural Language Processing, in support of LEAs to better prevent, detect and investigate criminal activities and terrorism and monitor borders, i.e., opportunities and benefits of AI tools and solutions in support of the work of Law Enforcement and to strengthen their operational cooperation.</li> </ul><p>Building on existing best practices such as those obtained through the ASGARD project <sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, proposals should establish a platform of easy-to-integrate and interoperable AI tools and an associated process with short research and testing cycles, which will serve in the short term perspective as a basis for identifying specific gaps that would require further reflection and development. This platform should, in the end, result in a sustainable AI community for LEAs, researchers and industry as well as a specific environment where relevant AI tools would be tailored to specific needs of the security sector, including the requirements of LEAs. Those AI tools would be developed in a timely manner using an iterative approach to define, develop and assess the most pertinent digital tools with a constant participation of end-users throughout the project. By the end of the project, the platform should also enable a direct access for Law Enforcement to an initial set of tools. Specific consideration should be given to the issue of setting an appropriate mechanism to enable a proper access to the relevant data necessary to develop and train AI based systems for security.</p><p>Proposals should also:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>develop cybersecurity tools and solutions for the protection of AI based technologies in use or to be used by LEAs, including those developed under this project against manipulation, cyber threats and attacks, and;</li><li>exploit AI technologies for cybersecurity operation purposes of Law Enforcement infrastructures, including the prevention, detection and response of cybersecurity incidents through advanced threat intelligence and predictive analytics technologies and tools targeting Cybercrime units of LEAs, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) of LEAs, Police and Customs Cooperation Centers (PCCCs), Joint Investigation Teams.</li> </ul><p>Finally, in order to have the full picture of all AI-related issues in the domain of work of Law Enforcement and citizen protection, proposals should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>tackle the fundamental dual nature of AI tools, techniques and systems, i.e.: resilience against adversarial AI, and prevention and protection against malicious use of AI (including malicious use of the LEA AI tools developed under this project) for criminal activities or terrorism.</li> </ul><p>The improvement of research results, application and uptake should be taken into consideration.</p><p>The functionality of existing EU LEAs' tools and systems needs to be analysed since they need to support the prevention, reaction and detection of cyber threats and security incidents.</p><p>Furthermore, the accuracy of AI tools depends on the quantity and on the quality of the training and testing data, including the quality of their structure and labelling, and how well these data represent the problem to be tackled. In the security domain, this issue is further emphasized due to the sensitivity of the data, which complicates the access to real multilingual datasets and the creation of representative datasets. A huge amount of up-to-date high-quality data needed to develop reliable AI tools in support of Law Enforcement, in the areas of cybersecurity and of the fight against crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, asks for the development of training/testing datasets at a European level. This requires a close cooperation of different national Law Enforcement and judiciary systems. Namely, training and testing data sets considered legal and used in one country have to be shared and accepted in another one, while simultaneously observing fundamental rights and substantial or procedural safeguards. The lack of legislation at the national and international level makes this particularly difficult. The availability of such datasets to the scientific community would ensure future advances in the field.</p><p>Thus, in order to address the problem of securing European up-to-date high-quality training and testing data sets in the domain of AI in support of Law Enforcement, proposals under this topic should, from a multidisciplinary point of view, identify, assess and articulate the whole set of actions that should be carried out in a coherent framework:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A comparative analysis of existing legal provisions throughout Europe that apply in these cases and their impact, including obstacles for research community to access datasets used by LEAs and means of overcoming these obstacles;</li><li>The identification and definition of legislative changes that could be promoted both at the European and Member State level;</li><li>Ethical and operational implications for LEAs;</li><li>The identification of the technical developments that should be carried out to sustain all these aspects;</li><li>Determination of legal and ethical means at the European level that allow for a creation of European up-to-date, representative and large enough high-quality training and testing data sets for AI, in support of Law Enforcement and available to the scientific community working with LEAs.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should have a clear dissemination plan, ensuring the uptake of project results by LEAs in their daily work.</p><p>Taking into account the European dimension of the topic, the role of EU agencies supporting Law Enforcement should be exploited regarding:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>effective channels established between industry and LEAs, closing the gap between public investment and uptake of project results by relevant end-users in their daily work;</li><li>increased exchange of experiences, best practices and lessons learnt throughout Europe leading to EU common approaches for opportunity/risk assessment of AI;</li><li>better understanding and readiness of policy makers on future trends in AI;</li><li>enhanced cooperative operations and synergies between EU LEAs.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should take into account the existing EU and national projects in this field, as well as build on existing research and articulate a legal, ethical and practical framework to take the best out of the AI based technologies, systems and solutions in the security dimension. Whenever appropriate, the work should complement, build on available resources and contribute to common efforts such as (but not limited to) ASGARD, SIRIUS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, EPE<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, networks of practitioners <sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, AI4EU<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup>, or activities carried out in the LEIT programme, namely in Robotics<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>, Big Data<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup>, and IoT<sup><a target=_self href=#fn9 id=r9>[9]</a></sup>. As proposals will leverage existing technologies (open source or not), they should show sufficient triage of these technologies to ensure no internalisation of Intellectual Property Rights or security risks as well as demonstrate that such technologies come with adequate license and freedom to operate.</p><p>As far as the societal dimension is concerned, proposed solutions of AI applications should respond to the needs of an individual and society as a whole by building and retaining trust. Proposals should analyse the societal implications of AI and its impacts on democracy. Therefore, the values guiding AI and responsible design practices that encode these values into AI systems should also be critically assessed. It should be also shown that the testing of the tools represents well the reality. In addition, AI tools should be unbiased (gender, racial, etc.) and designed in such a way that the transparency and explainability of the corresponding decision processes are ensured, which would, amongst other, reinforce the admissibility of any resulting evidence in court.</p><p>Proposals\u2019 consortia should comprehend, besides industrial and research participants, relevant security practitioners, civil society organisations, experts on criminal procedure from a variety of European Member States and Associated Countries as well as LEAs. Proposals should ensure a multidisciplinary approach and have the appropriate balance of IT specialists as well as Social Sciences and Humanities experts.</p><p>As indicated in the Introduction of this call, proposals should foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 17 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

[[\u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2013 A European Perspective\u201d, EUR 29425 EN, 2018.]] There are many different technologies that fall under this broad AI definition and they very much refer to machine learning, data science, robotics, internet of things and use of big data. Furthermore, many applications of AI have already started to appear in our everyday lives, from image recognition to machine translations or music generation, or very soon might become our reality, such as connected and autonomous vehicles or medical diagnostics. However, it is not always clear how best to foster innovation and how best to raise awareness about potential benefits and risks of this promising technology. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity.</p><p>To address the challenges and make the most of the opportunities offered by AI, the Commission published a European strategy[[COM(2018) 237.]] in April 2018.</p><p>The Commission proposed an approach that places people at the centre of the development of AI (human-centric AI) and encouraged the use of this powerful technology to help solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges, such as fighting crime and improving cybersecurity.</p><p>In order to improve the competitiveness of Europe in AI, it is necessary to map the existing research excellence and to boost and facilitate technology uptake. At the same time it remains indispensable to safeguard the strategic autonomy of the EU when developing security systems using AI technology by finding ways of embracing the opportunities offered by AI.</p><p>In December 2018, the Commission adopted a Communication on Working together for Artificial Intelligence [[COM(2018) 795 final.]] containing a Coordinated Action Plan, which has been drawn up jointly with Member States. With the Coordinated Action Plan, the Commission intends to maximise the impact of investment at the EU and national levels, encourage cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices, and support the EU\u2019s global competitiveness in this sector. Security aspects of AI are prominently present in all actions of the adopted plan, from research until putting such technologies on the market.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission is committed to embed the discussion on the risks and opportunities associated to AI in a wider development strategy for security, taking into account various scenarios, needs, gaps and alternatives that are specific to each area of security.</p><p>Moreover, under the next programming period beyond 2020, the Commission proposed to invest at least 1 billion EUR per year from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programmes into AI based technologies.[[COM(2018) 795 final.]] With the Digital Europe Programme, the Commission has put forward for the first time a dedicated programme to reinforce the EU's digital capacities in key technologies that might be further complemented by other funding instruments such as the Internal Security Fund, the future Border Management Fund or by the European Structural and Investment Funds.</p><p>AI is also becoming a topic of interest for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in Europe. Many Member States and Associated Countries have on-going initiatives to modernize the work of LEAs in this sense. However, AI asks for a significant technical and financial investment, due to which smaller countries may lag behind. Bringing this issue at EU level provides several advantages, such as possible economy of scale, centralized solutions on the issue of huge amount of data needed, or development of EU standards in this domain.</p><p>In order to scale up AI capacities of LEAs across Europe, close their AI skills gap, create synergies and tackle more efficiently their major challenges, it is essential to reach a critical mass through a close cooperation among the LEAs, research teams and industry. In such a way, the initiative would pave the way for a possible future establishment of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement, as a gravitational point of all AI-efforts related to LEAs, which would also, among others, contribute per se to achievement, when appropriate, of a European Strategic Autonomy in this critical dimension.</p><p>Such a European AI hub for LEAs should build on the AI-on-demand platform and be, where appropriate, linked to it so as to facilitate sharing of new technologies and advances across domains.</p><p>In addition, such a hub would serve as a common reference testing and experiment facility (could be a virtual network of physical facilities) to test state-of-the-art technology in the context of LEAs, taking into account all the technical and non-technical constraints imposed by the field (economic, legal, structural, organizational,\u2026). This hub could also include regulatory sandboxes, in order to test practical solutions in environments where the regulatory context might need to be adapted or defined.</p><p>A European AI hub would support LEAs by improving their daily work and quality of the tools they have, by increasing the protection of these tools and of LEA infrastructures, as well as by diminishing the number and impact of technologically sophisticated crimes. Thus, four interconnected aspects need to be addressed within this hub in order to exploit various possibilities of AI to provide full support to LEAs:</p><p>1- How can AI help LEAs in preventing, detecting and investigating criminal activities and terrorism and in monitoring borders?</p><p>2- At the same time, in order to support LEAs in their work, how can the malicious use of AI tools for criminal activities and terrorism be prevented, including malicious use of the AI tools developed in point 1?</p><p>3- Then, how can the AI tools used by LEAs, including the ones in point 1, be protected against cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>4- Finally, how can AI help in protecting LEA infrastructures from cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>AI can bring benefits to cybersecurity and to the fight against crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, but will introduce new challenges as well, some of them related to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To this end, a close cooperation of different national Law Enforcement and judiciary systems is necessary in order to secure the existence and availability of large enough and up-to-date high-quality datasets at a European level.</p><p>All topics in this call will be subject to security scrutiny.</p><p>Projects under this call are implemented through the use of complementary grants. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Proposals shall therefore foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices. This task will contribute to the actual set-up of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement at a later stage.</p>\n<p>The Commission reserves the possibility under this call to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">H2020-SU-AI-2018-2019-2020</span></b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:&#10;12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">A total of 23<b> proposals have been submitted </b>in response to this call.
