Highly regulated transport proteins fulfil this role, and it has been estimated that ~10% of the human genome is linked to membrane transport. The solute carrier (SLC) family is the largest class of such proteins (~400 members), and SLCs play vital roles across practically all cell types in all tissues. The importance of SLCs in disease can be illustrated by human genetic data which suggest that roughly 50% of SLCs are associated with a human disease-related phenotype compared to a rate of only ~20% for the broader human genome. A significant barrier to the study of SLCs is gaining access to relevant reagents and cell systems in which they are expressed</p><p>If these reagents become available it will lead to an acceleration in the discovery of effective new medicines for patients suffering from a range of diseases, to the benefit of society at large</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic aims to unlock the therapeutic potential within the SLC gene family by overcoming many of the technical barriers that have hindered their study and prevented their exploitation as drug targets by generating research tools and by making them freely available to the scientific community.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>New open access research tools, techniques, reagents, and knowledge to the biomedical research community that will rapidly accelerate the pace of research in the field of SLCs. These advances are expected to impact both basic research and drug discovery alike.</li>  <li>The discovery of new drug targets. Since SLCs are expressed in practically all cell types across all tissues, their therapeutic potential spans many disease areas, including, oncology, immunology, neurosciences, metabolism and cardiovascular diseases.</li>  <li>This project will benefit patients and society through the accelerated discovery of new drugs targeting SLCs which will provide effective therapies for broad range of diseases..</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<p>You can access the description of the different topics in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_fiches/jtis/h2020-call-fiche16-10-imi2-ju_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Call 10&nbsp;topics text</strong></a>.</p>\r\n<p>The budget breakdown for this Call is given at the end of the Call topics text, in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_fiches/jtis/h2020-call-fiche16-10-imi2-ju_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Conditions for this Call for proposals</strong></a>&nbsp;section, as well as the following information :</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding</span></strong><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions</span></strong><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and treshold: &nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">described in the <strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-pse-imi-ju-v1.4_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">IMI2 Manual for evaluation, submission and grant award</a>. </strong></span><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement</span></strong><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type of actions under the Call topics:</span></strong>  <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>IMI2 Research and Innovation Action (IMI2-RIA) and (IMI2-IA):<br />\r\n    </u><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-rel-prov-imi-ju_en.pdf\">Summary of the most relevant provisions for participating in IMI2 actions</a><br />\r\n    Proposal templates are available after entering the submission tool<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_ptef/ef/h2020-call-ef-imi2-ria-ia-2016_en.pdf\">Standard evaluation form</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/mga/jtis/h2020-mga-imi_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">IMI2 Model Grant Agreement</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/h2020_tmpl-clinical-studies_en.pdf \" target=\"_blank\">     Template for essential clinical trials information</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong>Contact the IMI Programme Office </strong>: E-mail: <u><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Infodesk@imi.europa.eu</span></strong></u><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\"> </span></strong>| Tel : +32 2 221 81 81</p>\r\n<p>Contact you <strong>SRG member</strong> for assistance:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/states-representatives-groups\"><strong>IMI States Representative Group (SRG)</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.imi.europa.eu/content/partner-search\"><strong>IMI Partner Search Tool</strong></a>&nbsp;helps you find a partner organisation for your proposal.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/index_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a></strong> your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;
