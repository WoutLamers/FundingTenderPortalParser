In addition to SST which addresses surveyance and tracking to prevent collision other aspects must be considered:\u00a0 </p><ol>  <li>Prevention, avoid adding new debris to the already large debris population. </li>  <li>Mitigation, specifically de-orbiting solutions for satellites and launcher upper stages at the end of their operational life.</li>  <li>Protection, i.e. shielding satellites from impact of small debris.</li> </ol><p><u>Scope:</u> To develop and test concepts and technologies needed for safe de-orbiting and disposal of space objects, including up to in-orbit demonstration as an option. Planned end-of-life de-orbiting or safe disposal of new satellites and launch vehicle\u2019s upper stages as well as non-technical issues including legal issues should be considered. </p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. </p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> Innovative and cost effective solutions, allowing scalable system-design, for post-mission disposal of satellites and launcher upper stages which are in line with or exceed international and European guidelines and legal requirements. </p><p><u>Type of action:</u>\u00a0 Research and innovation actions </p><p>\u00a0</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme <span style=\"color: #808080\">with the following exception: the European Space Agency will not participate in corsortia of proposals submitted under this call for proposals.<br />\r\n    </span>&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
