The participants in the CSA will provide platforms (toolkits and systems in the field of CBRN) in which to integrate the technologies and innovations developed by other companies under Part B).

Each of these actions will be led by an SME.

Such a collaboration agreement must settle how the results from the RIA will be exploited and integrated into platforms managed by the CSA.</p><p>The outcome of the proposal is expected to lead to development up to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 to 7 for the RIA under part b); please see part G of the General Annexes.</p><p>Indicative budget: The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of about \u20ac 2 million per action in 2016 and about \u20ac 3.5 million per action in 2017 would allow for this topic to be addressed appropriately.
