With the advantages of two different propulsion systems, hybrid electric vehicles can offer the possibility to drive both with zero emission and over long distances. They constitute a major enabler to reach future CO<sub>2</sub> targets and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in general, and play an important role in ensuring better air quality in urban areas and energy savings. However, a major challenge for this type of vehicle is the cost of its technology in relation to the benefit for end users and the variety of configurations that are possible. This topic is focused on the development of advanced solutions which reduce both the cost and complexity of pure hybrid, plug-in hybrid and range extended electric vehicles, and their effective mechanical, thermal and electrical integration into the vehicle.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should address all the following aspects in light-duty and/or heavy-duty vehicles:</p><p>\u2015For range extended electric vehicles, development of novel high efficiency and high power density energy generators and close integration with electric systems.</p><p>\u2015For pure and plug-in hybrids, power-train system integration and optimisation through the re-use of waste heat, advanced control, downsizing of ICEs, innovative transmissions and the integration of high temperature electronic components.</p><p>For all applications, identify potential for cost reduction by technical simplification of engine and/or transmission systems and lower cost energy storage as well as improved after-treatment operation to control of emissions, particularly in case of cold (re)start and optimised use of auxiliary systems, and, where economically justified, the re-use of waste heat.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 7 and 10 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>: In general, the cost premium for hybrid powertrains can be greater than the value of benefits to the user. The impact from this work will be to deliver improved benefits to the consumer and/or cost reductions that will lead to greater market penetration for this technology. Specifically, the expected impacts will consist of:</p><p>\u2015Reduction of cost at system level to a 5% premium over best in class 2015 non-hybrid diesel vehicle of equivalent size (15% for 30 km range plug-in solutions) when produced at a rate consistent with an overall 10% hybrid market penetration.</p><p>\u2015Contribution to climate action and sustainable development objectives by improving energy efficiency, resulting in higher fuel economy over the WLTP of 20% in the short to medium term and improvements in electric drive range of more than 25% for plug-in solutions at constant battery capacity depending on application and drive cycle duty.</p><p>\u2015Reduction of combustion engine raw emissions, thereby allowing cost reduction in the exhaust after-treatment system. Vehicle demonstration of real driving emissions compliance with a 1.5 compliance factor is mandatory for each developed technology.</p><p>\u2015Improvement of gradeability, drive-off performance and acceleration performance compared with a conventional vehicle.</p><p>\u2015Improved user acceptance for range extender systems delivering an improved driver experience and utility.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs)</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EGVI</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"> </span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
