Europe needs non-dependent access to critical space technologies, which is a conditio-sine-qua-non for achieving Europe\u2019s strategic objectives. \"Non-dependence\" refers to the possibility for Europe to have free, unrestricted access to any required space technology. Whenever possible multiple (&gt;1) sources for the critical technologies shall be promoted across Europe. Reaching non-dependence in certain technologies will open new markets to our industries and will increase the overall competitiveness of the European Space sector. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research in technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness has been undertaken within the frame of the Joint EC-ESA-EDA Task Force on Critical Technologies for European non-Dependence, launched in 2008.

High level specifications and key requirements can be found in the list of actions for 2015-2017.</p><p>Proposals should include a work package dedicated to the development of a commercial evaluation of the technology, and should address how to access the commercial market with a full range (preload) of recurring products.</p><p>A maximum of one proposal per identified priority technology line will be selected for funding.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific topic to be addressed appropriately.

The overarching objective is to contribute at European level, in conjunction with Member States and ESA, to the safeguarding and further development of a competitive and entrepreneurial space industry (including SMEs) and the strengthening of European non-dependence in space systems. This implies enabling advances in space technologies and operational concepts from idea to demonstration in representative terrestrial environments and/or in space.</p><p>Attention will be given to some clear trends in space technology development; on the one hand miniaturization on system and subsystem level, as well as in the development of instrumentation. On the other hand the development to generic technologies coming available for a number of different science and application areas. This leads to obvious synergies that should be promoted.</p><p>Competitiveness of European space industry is strongly dependent on performance in a global market, which has a high variability when compared to the institutional market. The ability to react to contract opportunities world-wide with recurring technologies for satellites is a critical success factor, and depends on ready access for integrators to subsystem and equipment capacities in Europe.</p><p>To ensure the competitive advantage, subsystems and/or equipment have to be technologically mature (i.e. at adequate technology readiness level (TRL[[Technology Readiness Levels are defined in part G of the General Annexes. In the specific area of space, TRL are defined under the standard ISO 16290. Further details on the TRL scale can be consulted in the European Space Agency website \"The ESA Science Technology Development Route\": <a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/sre-ft/50124-technology-readiness-level/05\">http://sci.esa.int/sre-ft/50124-technology-readiness-level/05</a>.]]), possibly flight proven) and be accompanied by adequate production rates. European focus in future space technologies, beyond the current state of the art, needs to be strengthened along the entire TRL scale: from low TRL key technologies to in-orbit demonstration and validation. Concrete support for IOD/IOV opportunities is planned for subsequent work programmes (2018-2020), considering previous results and evolving European priorities.</p><p>Technologies for satellite communication will be supported in particular in topics COMPET-2-2016 \"Maturing satellite communication technologies\" and in COMPET-3-2017 \"High data rate chain\". In addition, the topics COMPET-1-2016/2017 \"Technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness\" and COMPET-3-2016 \"In-space electrical propulsion and station keeping\" address important objectives for the satellite communication industry.</p><p>Earth observation underpins the mitigation of Europe's climate change challenges by facilitating sustainable services enabled by Copernicus. Technologies for Earth observation will be supported in particular in topics COMPET-2-2017 \"Competitiveness in Earth observation mission technologies\" and COMPET-3-2017 \"High data rate chain\". In addition, the topics COMPET-1-2016/2017 \"Technologies for European non-dependence and competitiveness\" also contribute to enabling technologies for Earth observation.</p><p>Technologies for satellite navigation are addressed in the Galileo part of the work programme.</p><p>Technologies enabling recurrence of use contribute to enhancing industrial competitiveness. Research on building blocks, components and items with potential for use in a variety of programmes and applications is therefore encouraged. Standardisation of such items by existing initiatives such as the European Space Components Coordination (ESCC) and the European Cooperation for Space Standardisation (ECSS), and their interfaces across Europe can optimise the investments and when applied appropriately facilitate access to emerging commercial markets. Synergies with ongoing work with ESA and Member States in the area of technology standardisation will be sought.</p><p><strong><em>Space exploration and science</em></strong></p><p>In 2017 support for space sciences and space exploration will address the exploitation of space science data on astrophysics (including exoplanets), heliophysics and the Solar System exploration, including the Moon. Other scientific domains will be addressed in following years.</p><p>This call will also address space weather.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 3, 2017 4:45:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 3, 2017 4:45:47 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the tab &quot;Topic conditions and documents&quot; (Additional documents) in each topic section.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 7, 2017 10:41:30 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 7, 2017 10:41:30 AM", "content": "<p>A total of 142 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is shown below:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>COMPET-1-2017: 17</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-2-2017: 34</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-3-2017: 13</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-4-2017: 46</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-5-2017: 14</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-6-2017: 12</li>\r\n    <li>COMPET-7-2017: 6</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The evaluation of the proposals, including an ethics screening, is planned to start on the 3rd of April and will be closed on the 9th of June 2017.
