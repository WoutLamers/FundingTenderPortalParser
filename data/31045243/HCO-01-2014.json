In a subset of these, stakeholder action groups have developed action plans for implementing innovative services for the ageing population. Another subset of priority action areas addresses domains whose readiness towards implementation is maturing and may soon give rise to additional action plans. </p><p>The EIP-AHA has invited, among others, the European Commission to establish favourable framework conditions to implement the actions outlined in the SIP. The European Commission, in its Communication \"Taking forward the Strategic Implementation Plan of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing\", committed to take account of relevant priorities of the SIP, together with input from other stakeholders, for future research and innovation work programmes and instruments. </p><p>Support is therefore required in facilitating: the execution of action plans, the establishment of favourable framework conditions for the deployment of the intended innovative services, and the future development of further action plans and priority areas. </p><p><u>Scope:</u> Proposals should provide coordinated support to the activities of the EIP-AHA as follows:</p><p>Support the existing action groups in implementing their action plans. The support may relate for example to coordination of action group activities, communication among partners and dissemination of results;</p><p>Support the development of new action plans coming from more priority action areas identified in the strategic implementation plan of the EIP-AHA, and subsequently, support the newly formed action groups in the same way as described above;</p><p>In collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including those from civil society, identify any new areas that can be regarded as future priority action areas, and develop a roadmap of research priorities, which are needed in the context of the existing and future priority action areas;</p><p>Work together with the European Commission, with relevant legislative and standardisation initiatives and with national, regional and local authorities in developing recommendations for more favourable regulatory and standardisation conditions, innovative procurement and incentive mechanisms.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact: </u></p><p>Proposals should present quantitative or qualitative indicators to quantify the potential impact of the following. </p><p>\u2022 Enhanced communication among EIP-AHA stakeholders, enhanced coordination of activities in the Action Groups of EIP-AHA and enhanced communication of their results.</p><p>\u2022 Identification of priority areas for Research and Innovation actions in the domain of Active and Healthy Ageing.</p><p>\u2022 Accelerated progress in the establishment of favourable framework conditions to implement the actions outlined in the Action Plans of the EIP-AHA.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Coordination and support actions</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    In recognition of the opening of the US National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s programmes to European researchers, any legal entity established in the United States of America is eligible to receive Union funding to support its participation in projects supported under all topics in calls under the Societal Challenge &lsquo;Health, demographic change and well-being&rsquo;.&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
