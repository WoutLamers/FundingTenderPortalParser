The focus of the action should preferably aim at European engineering and manufacturing SMEs.</p><p>The proposal will define the process of selecting SMEs for which financial support will be granted. Taking into account the complexity of projects involving access to advanced HPC services, such as for example AI/HPDA, etc., typically the financial support will be in the order of EUR 50 000 \u2013 150 000<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> per party. At least 80% of the JU funding should be allocated to financial support for these third parties.</p><p>The selected project should collaborate with the future national HPC Competence Centres and the related coordination action (topic EuroHPC-04-2019 in this Work Plan), if selected for funding, Digital Innovation Hubs, or other relevant domain-oriented or industry associations.</p><p>The JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the JU of between EUR 8 and 10 million and a duration of 3 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals with another duration or requesting other amounts.
