This should enable transformative research not only at the forefront of European science but also to become a benchmark on a global scale.</p><p>Applicants Principal Investigators must demonstrate the synergies, complementarities and added value that could lead to <strong>breakthroughs that would not be possible by the individual Principal Investigators working alone</strong>.</p><p><strong><em>Size of ERC Synergy Grants </em></strong></p><p>Synergy Grants may be awarded up to a maximum of <strong>EUR 10 000 000</strong> for a period of <strong>6 years</strong>.

The panels may be assisted by independent experts working remotely.<br />\r\n    The composition of the panels at each step is not predefined but will be decided dynamically in relation to the proposals received. <br />\r\n    Applicant Principal Investigators can request during the electronic proposal submission that up to four specific persons should not act as an evaluator in the evaluation of their proposal.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    - <u>At step 1</u> : One panel formed from approximately 80 panel members and chairs will assess the extended synopsis (and not the full scientific proposal) and the Principal Investigators&rsquo; track records and CVs.<br />\r\n    - <u>At step 2</u> : Panel Members from step 1 will be divided in five panels of around 15 experts each having the best expertise for a group of proposals. They will assess the complete version of the retained proposals&nbsp; (including the full scientific proposal).<br />\r\n    - <u>At step 3</u> :&nbsp;the interview panels may be reconfigured to ensure the best expertise for the proposals. The most competitive of the retained proposals will be identified and their Principal Investigators will be invited for an interview to present their project to a panel meeting in Brussels.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Evaluation criteria:<br />\r\n    </strong><br />\r\n    For all ERC frontier research grants excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation.
