The specific challenge is to communicate at the right moments, with the appropriate key messages on what bio-based products are and can be used for, their benefits for man and environment and the role of the bio-based industries, while also addressing the concerns of the society. This communication programme needs to closely cooperate with communications programmes within H2020 on bio-based products and to Regional activities addressing the same to achieve synergy.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Develop well-formulated, science-based facts and figures on bio-based products, key messages on benefits and risk management, addressing societal concerns. Develop case studies on practical solutions for end-users and involve organisations representing the society at large. A communication programme utilising the appropriate key messages for the target audiences should also include a feedback loop to incorporate citizens reactions and for continuous improvement of the programme. Other key messages should include the benefits of a bioeconomy, and the contributions the bio-based industries bring to communities at large in terms of jobs and economic growth, of welfare and wealth.

Survey results should be used to adapt priorities and communication key messages.</li>  <li>Increase public confidence by providing clear information on the performance, (comparative) functionality and end-of-life options of bio-based products.</li>  <li>Develop together with societal and research organisations and in cooperation with educational organisations teaching materials for use in educational systems at various levels (primary, secondary, vocational, university) across the EU.</li>  <li>Explore possibilities for synergy with regional activities and EU initiatives (e.g. European Innovation Partnerships) that address similar needs.</li>  <li>Build on and coordinate with ongoing Horizon 2020 projects dealing with communication and public consultation in the field of bio-based productsa communication programme to overcome the lack of information on bio-based products and to mobilise engagement and raise awareness among citizens and various stakeholder groups.</li> </ul><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
