Only in more recent years, the political and economic developments in the five countries of the region - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - have received more attention. Challenges related to weak governments, abuse of power and corruption, divided societies, border disputes and ethnic tensions have led to increasing political and religious militancy and the creation of extremist groups which potentially represent non-negligible suppliers of forces to the radical political and religious movements in the neighbouring countries. Today's relevance of Central Asia in general and to the trade, security and development strategies of the European Union<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> and other world powers in particular is, however, not reflected in the level of attention which the region is given from a scientific, social sciences and humanities point of view. Not only are Central Asian Studies less of a priority for European research centres, but European researchers in this field are also not sufficiently coordinated and their work is not adequately linked to policymaking.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Taking into account the need for a more intensive and properly coordinated research in the field of Central Asian Studies and the need for closer links to EU policy making, a network of European researchers will be created which, in cooperation with researchers from Central Asian countries, will:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>through mapping the current state of affairs in the field of Central Asian Studies in Europe and European Studies in Central Asia, recommend relevant new forms and priorities for future EU scientific cooperation in social sciences and the humanities with the region;</li>  <li>through mapping the current state of political, economic, trade, cultural and any other relations between the EU and its Member States with Central Asian countries as well as between Central Asian countries and countries in the rest of Asia, and analysing results of the existing measures and tools supporting them, recommend future priorities for European policy making. These recommendations should be prepared in close cooperation with any other relevant European and Central Asian stakeholders (e.g. local, regional and state authorities, not-for-profit sectors, representatives of businesses, etc.);</li>  <li>prepare an awareness-raising dissemination and communication strategy for the promotion of Central Asia and its role for Europe, which could be used by a variety of stakeholders (e.g. education, media, EU public sphere in general).</li> </ul><p>Any consortium submitting a proposal to this call should ensure a balanced representation of partners from countries in Central Asia.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The coordination and support measures of this action will contribute to improving the ties of the EU with the region and countries of Central Asia in all socio-economic, political, security as well as cultural and scientific areas. Its findings will primarily be focused on the formulation of short- and long-term priorities for EU policies towards the region, as well as on proposing methods for their achievement. They will be further used for education and media purposes and thus contribute to raising awareness among EU citizens of today\u2019s reality of the countries of Central Asia and of their importance for Europe. By creating a network of European researchers in the field of Central Asian Studies and by proposing new forms of cooperation with counterparts in Central Asia, the action will reinforce mutual research ties between the EU and Central Asian countries and establish a robust basis for their sustained collaboration.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&amp;I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders.

Recent developments show just how dynamically the strategic and geopolitical contexts are changing. These developments represent intricate challenges but also opportunities for Europe to develop and vary its analysis and build more robust anticipative, proactive and reactive capacities.</p><p>In such turbulent times, greater emphasis should be placed on fostering new types of actions that allow for engaging together globally, which strengthen the position of Europe on the global scene, including by improving the coordination between EU Member States and broadening its means of external action.</p><p>To better anticipate and address challenges in key regions, it is essential to maximise the EU\u2019s clout in global affairs. Research activities will look into the best means of ensuring synergies and consistency between Member States, EU foreign policy goals and instruments. Maximising its clout also presupposes understanding Europe in a global context and its historical and cultural legacy.</p><p>It is also imperative to implement the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation by strengthening activities to promote the position of Europe on the global scene, attract international partners to Horizon 2020, enhance research and innovation exchanges and dialogue, and strengthen the European R&amp;I presence in strategic partner countries and regions.</p><p>In Work Programme 2014-2015 topics focused on issues in the immediate EU neighbourhood regions (both South and East), as well as joint challenges with strategic partners such as cultural, scientific and social relations with Latin America.</p><p>In complement, this Work Programme presents Topics 1 and 2 on challenges of geopolitical shocks and radicalisation that appear in cross-cutting way in several Topics and Calls of SC6[[Topics REV-INEQUAL-02-2016 and REV-INEQUAL-04-2016 address radicalisation and migration trends within Europe.]] and SC7, as well as integration and science diplomacy. Proposals to this set of topics are encouraged to address issues across these challenges.</p><p>Topic 4 targets the use of scientific knowledge on the EU's neighbouring countries and regions for EU policy-making. Topic 5 investigates EU external trade strategies and their inter-linkages, coherence and effectiveness vis-\u00e0-vis other external policies.</p><p>Topics 6, 7 and 8 broaden the geographical coverage of the first Work Programme focusing on Asia-Pacific, Central Asia, and China specifically.</p><p>Topic 9 addresses the challenge of strengthening the position of Europe as a global actor by reinforcing the presence of European research and innovation actors in selected international partner countries and regions.</p><p>Topics 3 and 10 deal with migration and asylum systems.</p><p>In all Topics the participation of entities from the international partner countries and regions concerned is strongly encouraged.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 8, 2017 7:02:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 8, 2017 7:02:03 PM", "content": "<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-ENG-GLOBALLY-2016-2017</p>\r\n<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available&nbsp; under the &lsquo;Topic conditions &amp; documents&rsquo; section on the topic page of the following topics:</p>\r\n<p>ENG-GLOBALLY-1:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-2:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-3:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-5:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-6:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-10:RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-8: RIA<br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-4: CSA <br />\r\nENG-GLOBALLY-7: CSA</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe submission session is now available for: ENG-GLOBALLY-02-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-07-2017(CSA), ENG-GLOBALLY-04-2017(CSA), ENG-GLOBALLY-03-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-06-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-01-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-05-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-08-2016-2017(RIA), ENG-GLOBALLY-10-2017(RIA)</p>\r\n<p>CALL : H2020-SC6-ENG-GLOBALLY-2016-2017<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Thursday 2 of February 17 Pm 2017.
