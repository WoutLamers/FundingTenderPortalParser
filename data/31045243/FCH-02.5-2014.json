Also, it is necessary to increase the value proposition of fuel cell based products by increasing power security and reducing exploitation of primary energy resources. Power generation is not limited to electricity only, but including heat, cold and potentially hydrogen as by-products. This topic targets development, manufacturing and validation of a new generation of fuel cell systems with properties that significantly improve competitiveness. New innovative system technologies are implemented and validated in a new product with lower product cost, maintenance need and extended lifetime. Only through development of competitive technologies can fuel cell products achieve market readiness and radically improve the sustainability and security of energy supply.</p><p>Building and validating first prototypes of the new product generation will build trust among the stakeholders and build a basis for further growth of the industry. The project will engage dedicated suppliers to establish close cooperation with system integrators to further develop efficient value chains that will support commercialization. </p><p>Reduction of primary energy by CHP or other ways of co- and polygeneration, also including co-generation of H2 as side product (links to mobility).</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 The primary objective of the call is to manufacture and validate 10 \u2013 100 kW next generation fuel cell products having premium electrical efficiency and capability for CHP generation.
