Ambitious renovation of the ageing building stock offers huge potential to reduce that energy consumption. Lowering the energy costs for households while increasing in-house comfort will not only help to achieve EU environmental objectives, but will also benefit EU economy and contribute to social well-being.</p><p>A large-scale deep rehabilitation of the residential building stock to match the net-zero energy standards at affordable price must be achieved. Breakthrough solutions are required to reduce energy consumption in building (e.g. in space heating/cooling and domestic hot water production, maximising the envelope performances, heat recovery and local use of renewables) with the support of advanced BEM (Building Energy Management) systems. Proposals should go beyond the state of the art and previous project results of the EeB PPP.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research should address in-depth analysis and subsequent improvement of the renovation process, including innovative technical elements/products/processes aiming to improve the decision-making, and should be based on a collaborative multi-value multi-stakeholder exercise. Methodology, guidelines and effective operational tools are needed to ease the selection between renovation scenarios. The analysis should take into account life cycle assessment, life cycle costing, indoor environment quality, as well as user behaviour and acceptance. Research should lead to innovative concepts for a systemic approach to retrofitting which integrates the most promising cost-effective technologies and materials, in order to reduce heat losses through the building envelope and also the energy consumption by ventilation and other energy distribution systems, while increasing the share of renewable energy in buildings.</p><p>The new tools will help revalorisation of existing buildings in the long term, including the energy performance of the building as a factor of the total property value. This should be reflected in the definition of innovative business models where all relevant actors are involved, including public authorities and investors.</p><p>Proposals should aim at maximizing the capacity of replication of the developed concepts and methods for integrated sustainable renovation. Large-scale market uptake should be addressed, for example by targeting buildings with similar use conditions and/or comparable blocks of buildings or districts in need for renovation.</p><p>Proposals should show clear evidence of technical and financial viability of the solution through their application on real case demonstrations.</p><p><strong>Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6</strong>. This topic addresses cross-KET activities.</p><p><em>A significant participation of SMEs with R&amp;D capacities is encouraged.</em></p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 7 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Reduction of at least 60% in energy consumption in order to reach the target of near zero energy compared to the values before renovation, while enhancing indoor environmental quality.</li>  <li>Decrease of installation time by at least 30% compared to typical renovation process for the building type.</li>  <li>Demonstration of a high replicability potential and of large market uptake capacity.</li>  <li>Affordability considering all costs involved, with a payback period below 15 years.</li>  <li>New generation of skilled workers and SME contractors in the construction sector capable of applying a systemic approach to renovation.</li> </ul><p><em>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme</em>.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a

It represents about 7 % of the EU28 non-financial business economy and provides <strong>11.5 million direct jobs</strong> (about 8.8% of total employment in the non-financial business economy<strong>)</strong>[[Based on EUROSTAT statistical business survey [sbs_na_sca_r2] and as also reflected in table 1.1. (page 17) and table 1.3 (page 21)in the JRC study available at: <a href=\"http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/system/tdf/eur26888_buildingreport_online.pdf?file=1&amp;type=node&amp;id=9069\">http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/system/tdf/eur26888_buildingreport_online.pdf?file=1&amp;type=node&amp;id=9069</a>]]<strong>. </strong>Furthermore the built environment affects the life and work of all EU-citizens: The construction sector also has a crucial impact on the EU environment and energy policies as buildings use <strong>40 % of total EU energy consumption</strong> and <strong>responsible for 36% of Green-House Gases</strong> in Europe while the replacement rate of the existing stock is very small (1-2% per year).</p><p>The buildings sector is on the critical path to decarbonise the European economy by 2050 in line with the Energy Union Strategy. In order to achieve this objective it must enable reducing its CO2 emissions by 90% and its energy consumption by as much as 50%. In this way, the construction and building sector will support the implementation of the COP21 Paris Agreement and contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, including SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'.</p><p>This is a unique opportunity for sustainable business growth provided that products and related services for both new and refurbished buildings are affordable and of durable quality, in line with several current or future European Directives. Yet, together with the 2050 deadlines, such Directives are putting more constraints on a sector which is directly impacted by the on-going financial and economic crisis, taking into account that, although Europe has major companies, <strong>this sector is highly fragmented with over 95% of SMEs</strong>.</p><p>The objective of the <em>Energy-efficient Buildings</em> Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Initiative is to drive the creation of a high-tech building industry which turns energy efficiency into a sustainable business, fostering EU competitiveness in the construction sector on a global level.</p><p>This call will complement the call on Energy Efficiency of the Energy societal challenge, by helping deliver, implement and optimise building and district concepts that have the technical, economic and societal potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and decrease CO2 emissions, both in relation to new buildings and to the renovation of existing buildings. This new initiative should have a large payoff, as it will increase the market for energy-efficient, clean and affordable buildings. Priority will be given to delivering new building technologies, materials and components for energy saving and energy generation, thermal energy storage systems, advanced insulation systems, thermal distribution systems, lighting, windows and glazing, energy generation systems based on renewable sources. Priorities also include reliable simulation and prediction tools, including assessment methods that integrate economic, social and environmental issues, including comfort and safety. To date, the construction industry has difficulty to effectively integrate key technologies into its operations in order to achieve sustainable, long-term competitiveness and such integration should also be promoted.</p><p>Activities supported under the EeB PPP are expected to contribute to EU industrial leadership and the grand societal challenges.</p><p>The participation of public authorities may be an asset for some projects, as public authorities own a large part of the building stock at European level.</p><p>The EeB cPPP will support a high-tech building industry which turns the need for energy efficiency into an opportunity for sustainable business, fostering EU competitiveness in the construction sector at the global level.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 27, 2017 5:00:49 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 27, 2017 5:00:49 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>FLASH INFORMATION ON THE CALL RESULTS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>H2020-EEB-2016-2017 (2017 TOPICS)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Published: 14 October 2015<br />\r\nDeadline: 19 January 2017<br />\r\nAvailable budget: 54.88 M&euro;</p>\r\n<p>The Commission has now completed the evaluation of the proposals submitted to the above-mentioned call.<br />\r\nThe results of the evaluation are as follows:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNumber of proposals submitted (including proposals transferred from or to other calls): 52<br />\r\nNumber of inadmissible proposals: 3<br />\r\nNumber of ineligible proposals: 1<br />\r\nNumber of above-threshold proposals: 13<br />\r\nTotal budget requested for above-threshold proposals: 75,463,464.18 &euro;</p>\r\n<p>We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals.</p>\r\n<p>For questions, please contact the Research Enquiry Service.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 25, 2017 5:13:00 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 25, 2017 5:13:00 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>Deadline: 19.01.2017</strong></span><br />\r\nA total of 52 proposals were submitted in response to this call. <br />\r\nThe number of proposals for each topic is shown below:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEEB-05-2017:\t27<br />\r\nEEB-06-2017:\t10<br />\r\nEEB-07-2017:\t11<br />\r\nEEB-08-2017:\t4</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:32:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:32:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EEB-05-2017(IA), EEB-06-2017(RIA), EEB-07-2017(IA), EEB-08-2017(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 25, 2016 3:02:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 25, 2016 3:02:03 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2017 update</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>After the update to the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2017 of 25 July 2016,<br />\r\nthe following updates were made:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Open Access Data new provisions have been added for 2017 calls with an opening date on or after 26/07/2016.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The introduction of the call H2020-EEB-2016-17 has been modified. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The indicative budget for call H2020-EEB-2017 was increased to &euro;54.88 million in 2017.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 19, 2016 4:18:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 19, 2016 4:18:48 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>An overview of the following evaluation results (flash call info) is now available <br />\r\nunder the tab Topic conditions and documents:</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>2016 topics</li>\r\n</ul>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 25, 2016 10:07:43 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 25, 2016 10:07:43 AM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>2016 EEB topics - Deadline: 21.01.16</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>59 proposals were submitted in response to this call.<br />\r\nThe number of proposals for each topics is shown below:</p>\r\n<p>EeB-01: 24<br />\r\nEeB-02: 5<br />\r\nEeB-03: 9<br />\r\nEeB-04: 21</p>\r\n<p>F<strong>or FOF and SPIRE topics see <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ind-ce-2016-17.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IND-CE-2016-17/1/1/1&amp;callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&amp;callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&amp;callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&amp;+identifier/desc\">here</a></strong></p>"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
