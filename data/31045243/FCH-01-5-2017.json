The majority of European bus OEMs are gearing up to meet the challenge.</p><p>In order to further contribute and extend the uptake of fuel cell buses as the next step in the commercialisation process, the following specific challenges have to be met:</p><p>1. A further reduction of the capital cost of the fuel cell buses in line with increased volume (total and per site) while at the same time lowering the match funding and the EU contribution.</p><p>2. In order to drive the cost to a level of commercial competitiveness with other zero emission technologies, the programme will allow fuel cell buses to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Eliminate technological barriers identified in previous projects, e.g. by optimizing the hybrid driveline (latest development of batteries in combination with next generation fuel cells) ;</li>  <li>Fully develop the necessary supply chains and value chains for related services, including availability of trained personnel, spare parts, etc\u2026, in order to bring this technology on a par with conventional technologies.</li> </ul><p>3. Considering that most operators have procured or are in the process of procuring battery electric buses, the challenge for fuel cell buses will be to demonstrate the distinct operating advantages of fuel cell buses;</p><p>4. Reduce the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), including fuel, infrastructure and maintenance cost and put the value of societal benefits (environmental, health etc.) in the right perspective as a way to further the use of the technology;</p><p>5. Achieve quantified per kilometre well-to-wheel GHG reductions compared with other zero emission alternatives, based on the anticipated revised European Directive for Clean Vehicles [1].</p><p>6. Extend the range of potential bus models to all lengths between 9 and 24 meters, including double decker buses.</p><p>7. Include range extender models for heavy duty city bus use</p><p>8. Include different climate zones and city planning architecture, including interested regions where no FCB demonstration took place so far;</p><p>9. Provide answers to the operators as to the degree by which fuel cell buses meet or exceed the fleet operational requirements and expectations, in the different service conditions.</p><p>10. Identify and quantify the remaining barriers to market, including financing and merging options with other programmes and sources as well as a plan to implement</p><p>11.

One of the lessons learned in previous projects is the importance of operator\u2019s involvement from the start to embrace the technology in daily operation. The buses are expected to be close to commercial readiness from both a technical maturity and an economic perspective. Prototypes or small initial series may be procured in the programme subject to the terms of the tender.</p><p>To achieve the projected result, at least 100 of the buses will be deployed in larger fleets, these will have a minimum fleet size of 10 buses, and at least 3 of these cities will be deployed in fleets of 20 or more. In addition, up to 5 sites shall procure at least 5 buses. It is recommended to consortium to seek additional source of funding for the related HRS. The buses will be demonstrated for a period of at least 36 months or 150,000 km in operational service and continue service after the project has ended (e.g. the bids could include a commitment as to the minimum period to continue the service after the project has ended). New hydrogen infrastructure or upgrades of existing HRS will also be created.</p><p>Buses should have min fuel cell output of 30 kW. Buses below 10m length can be equipped with a fuel cell of minimum of 20 kW.</p><p><u>Buses:</u></p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>The following is generally applicable for 12m fuel cell bus as defined.

The involvement of SMEs is encouraged.</p><p>TRL level shall be 8 for the buses and TRL level for the HRS shall be at least 8 (at beginning of the project).</p><p>Any safety-related event that may occur during execution of the project shall be reported to the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), which manages the European hydrogen safety reference database, HIAD (dedicated mailbox <a href=\"mailto:JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu\">JRC-PTT-H2SAFETY@ec.europa.eu</a>).</p><p>The maximum FCH 2 JU contribution that may be requested is EUR 25 million.
