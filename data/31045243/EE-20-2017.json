Data centres should become more energy efficient and should maximise integration of renewable energy sources. Intermittent renewable energy sources need to be combined with energy storage (electricity or cold/heat) to ensure efficient and secure energy management in data centres. In addition, existing and new data centres should be better integrated into the various energy grids (electricity and/or heat) in order to turn their energy use and waste into a benefit for the whole energy system. Previous research activities in this area have identified a wide array of innovative solutions and concepts. However, further research and development activities are needed to bring them to the market. Speeding up the time-to-market of these promising solutions is the main challenge under this topic.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Innovation Actions are needed to increase the energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy sources and integration of data centres in the energy system. Proposals should cover several following areas: innovative and energy efficient cooling solutions, waste heat reuse, geographical and temporal workload balance, integration of local and remote renewable energy sources, integration in smart grids, integration with district heating/cooling networks, integration of power backup system in the grid and use of heat pumps for efficient use of waste heat etc. Proposals should include the development of business models to trade heat, cold, electricity or energy security and storage. Proposals should build upon the results of previous projects such as the ones funded under the FP7-Smartcities Call 2013 (namely RenewIT, DC4Cities, Dolfin, Genic, GreenDataNet, GEYSER). Proposals should focus on new and existing data centres (indicatively from 500 kW to 1 MW IT load).</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Proposals are expected to demonstrate the impacts listed below (wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets):</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Bring data centre specific innovative energy efficiency technologies and solutions, already developed by research projects, to market faster and cheaper.</li>  <li>Reaching a Power Usage Effectiveness<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> of up to 1.2.</li>  <li>Achieve a high share of the data centre energy consumption covered by sustainable energy resources.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is a measure of how efficiently a computer data centre uses energy;

Projects funded under this topic will therefore by default provide open access to the research data they generate, except if they decide to opt-out under the conditions described in annex L of the Work Programme. Projects can opt-out at any stage, that is both before and after the grant signature.</p>\r\n    <p>Note that the evaluation phase proposals will not be evaluated more favourably because they plan to open or share their data, and will not be penalised for opting out.</p>\r\n    <p>Open research data sharing applies to the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications. Additionally, projects can choose to make other data available open access and need to describe their approach in a Data Management Plan.</p>\r\n    <p>- Projects need to create a Data Management Plan (DMP), except if they opt-out of making their research data open access. A first version of the DMP must be provided as an early deliverable within six months of the project and should be updated during the project as appropriate. The Commission already provides guidance documents, including a template for DMPs.</p>\r\n    <p>- Eligibility of costs: costs related to data management and data sharing are eligible for reimbursement during the project duration.</p>\r\n    <p>The legal requirements for projects participating in this pilot are in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf#page=66\">article 29.3 of the Model Grant Agreement</a>.</p>\r\n    <p><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Additional documents:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    </strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-intro_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Introduction</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-energy_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Secure, clean and efficient energy</a><strong><br />\r\n    </strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-comm-diss_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Dissemination, Exploitation and Evaluation</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-ga_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: General Annexes</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment </a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation </a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme&nbsp;</a><br />\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal4/desktop/en/funding/guide.html\">H2020 Online Manual</a></strong> your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash; Submission of proposals.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal4/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html\">National Contact Points (NCP)</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></strong><span>contact your NCP for further assistance.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?lg=en&amp;pg=enquiries\">Research Enquiry Service</a></span></strong><span> &ndash; ask questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular.</span><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/api/contact/index.html\"><br />\r\n<strong>IT Helpdesk</strong></a>- contact the Participant Portal IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>EASME Energy Unit</strong>: <a href=\"mailto:EASME-ENERGY@ec.europa.eu\">EASME-ENERGY@ec.europa.eu</a><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\nEthics</strong> &ndash; for compliance with ethical issues, see the<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/ethics_en.htm\"> Participant Portal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/index.cfm?fuseaction=public.topic&amp;id=1289&amp;lang=1\">Science and Society Portal</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/\"><br />\r\n<strong>European IPR Helpdesk</strong></a> assists you on intellectual property issues<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cen.eu/cen/Services/Innovation/Pages/default.aspx\"><br />\r\n<strong>CEN</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.cenelec.eu/aboutcenelec/whatwestandfor/fosterinnovation/randd.html\"><strong>CENELEC</strong></a>, the European Standards Organisations, advise you how to tackle standardisation in your project proposal.
