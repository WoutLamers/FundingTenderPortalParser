For <b>Africa</b> the proposal will also include support for the implementation of activities agreed within the EU-Africa High Level Policy Dialogue, including by increasing the coordination between the activities and programmes from the Member States, the Associated Countries and the African partners.</p><p>Proposals should be made by consortia consisting of balanced partnerships between European and international partners, ensuring adequate involvement of public authorities and other stakeholders (e.g. funding agencies, research organisations, industry, civil society) of the participating countries. On the European side, broad involvement across all Member States and Associated Countries is expected, either within the consortium or through appropriate outreach activities by the consortium to other Member States and Associated States. Broad participation from the targeted region is also strongly encouraged. Proposals should build on the results of existing cooperation initiatives, and in particular those funded through the Seventh Framework Programme Capacities part 'Activities of International Cooperation'.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Coordination and support actions </p><p>A maximum of one proposal will be supported per international partner region from the list provided above. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1.95 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately for the proposals targeting Africa and the Southern Mediterranean Neighbourhood. For the proposals targeting the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea region, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1.5 million per proposal for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. For the proposals targeting the Middle East, the Commission considers that a proposal requesting a Union contribution of EUR 1 million for a duration of three years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
