The republic of Korea has launched an ambitious set of projects (e.g. Giga-Korea project) towards early deployment by 2020. Beyond regional developments, a certain level of technological convergence at an early stage during the research phases is considered beneficial to ensure future consensus on global standards, timeline or spectrum usage. Similarly, global convergences at use case and applicability levels of future 5G networks are considered useful.</p><p>A key challenge will be to avoid and overcome the fragmentation of multiple initiatives to address technologies with similar characteristics, use case potential thus fostering global interoperability and wide spread adoption.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Research and Innovation Actions</strong></p><p>It covers technology demonstration that addresses and demonstrates feasibility of an integrated architectural approach towards heterogeneous accesses (with emphasis on mmWave access including RF/Antenna, Relay, Base stations and Terminals), high capacity/resilient backhaul, an evolved packet core implemented through NFV/SDN based core functions, high precision/integrity positioning techniques for advanced location based services/timing and satellite communication and navigation technologies where appropriate.</p><p>The setup of the demonstration should allow to show the principle support of specific requirements of vertical sectors, though not at the stage of a large scale implementation. Most challenging 5G characteristics should be targeted for the technology demonstration, for instance latency in the ms range, capability to serve very dense user environments without loss of performance (such as throughput or energy consumption), capability to provide various network functions (e.g., mobile core, heterogeneous fixed and mobile access convergence, satellite, virtualization, orchestration), capability to support high precision/integrity ubiquitous location based services and timing, capability to support various types of IoT, and interoperability between them. Furthermore, the capability should be demonstrated to efficiently provide ubiquitous 5G services.</p><p>The main output of the work is a proof of concept for an interoperability/architecture framework which demonstrates a possible way forward for the needed definition of the interoperability specifications, that future 5G products have to achieve, and towards related standardisation activities for existing and new interfaces.</p><p>Prototype installations and proof of concept are expected to be implemented and demonstrated in the context of the 2018 Olympic Games of Pyungchang.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Contribution to the definition of a 5G interoperability architectural framework</li>  <li>Contribution to the identification of key interfaces to standardise</li>  <li>Contribution to the integration framework towards access and core</li>  <li>Support to related standardisation activities (e.g. 3G PP)</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>).&nbsp;<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>Additional admissibility criterion:<br />\r\n    </u>- Participants in the EU collaborative projects are required to conclude a coordination agreement with the participants in the coordinated project funded by MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) or IITP (Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion).
