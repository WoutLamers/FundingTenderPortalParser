Through its main components, the EOSC website, catalogue of services and marketplace<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, researchers and other users can find and use research-enabling services and resources, get technical support, integrated solutions from the EOSC providers, participate in co-design, and be informed about and engaged with, the EOSC vision and policy initiatives.</p><p>Building on this work, the challenge is now to consolidate and scale up the EOSC Portal and its underlying service platform in order to: 1) strengthen the EOSC Portal so that it continues to provide an increasing portfolio of high quality standard compliant and interoperable services of proven user interest and scientific relevance from a wide range of national, regional and institutional public research infrastructures in Europe as well as from commercial service providers in its catalogue; 2) reinforce the role of the marketplace as the access channel to integrated, composable and reliable services; 3) attract more users, within the research community and beyond, by enhancing the user experience and seamlessly accommodating their needs; and 4) ensure its long-term sustainability taking into account all the relevant governance and business frameworks.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Building on the outcomes of the projects awarded under topics EINFRA-12-2017<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, INFRAEOSC-06-2019 (a), INFRAEOSC-05-2018 (a), INFRAEOSC-04-2018 and other relevant EU funded projects and initiatives<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> (including the thematic clouds), proposals should address the following activities all together:</p><p>a. Operation, maintenance and enhancement of the EOSC Portal (the website, the catalogue of services and the marketplace)</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhance operational aspects of the EOSC Portal: proposals should include tools and activities to ensure the basic functionalities underpinning the portal, such as the support, quality, security, reliability and traceability of services, effective monitoring of usage and evaluation of performance, messaging and usage accounting. A user-friendly interface, offering integrated information on the EOSC vision and process, should be also ensured, encouraging constant learning and alignment in all disciplines and Member States.</li><li>Engage with the supply side of EOSC: proposals should provide a framework to interact with all service and resources providers<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, in order to ensure that their services are integrated into the catalogue of services and, where appropriate, the marketplace. They should also ensure the alignment of the providers with future EOSC principles, standards and values including compliance with the Rules for Participation and FAIR principles<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> and the reduction of the complexity barrier to users. Consortia should address issues related to the adoption of common standards by all suppliers, the implementation of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the automatic collection and exchange of information related to service updates, the mechanisms for reporting usage, the support for virtual access accounting mechanisms<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>, etc.</li><li>Interact with the EOSC end users and provide a highly usable service platform: proposals should foresee the necessary feedback mechanisms (including a user panel) and user behaviours\u2019 analysis within the EOSC Portal environment to allow for constant improvement of the features of the different EOSC Portal components and their usability easing the way users can interact and evaluate the service. The analysis should include gender sensitive issues, when relevant. Proposals should also put in place the necessary mechanisms to elicit users\u2019 needs requiring new services (including commercial ones).</li> </ul><p>b. Fostering and enabling secure service composability</p><p>To allow for a higher level of service integration within the EOSC marketplace, proposals should take due consideration of the need for secure composition of services and resources from different providers. Researchers and other EOSC end users should be able to discover services and combine them to compose new, more complex services, tailored to their specific needs. By enabling EOSC users to compose reliable, secure and scalable services, the EOSC marketplace will become more flexible and adaptable, maximising its impact and benefit for the research community.</p><p>In this context, proposals should provide a framework, including specific pilot scenarios, for exposing, integrating and managing a wide-range of standard and policy compliant cross-domain and domain-specific research enabling services and resources from pan-European horizontal and thematic research infrastructures as well as from commercial providers. In particular, they should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Allow for user friendly discovery, access and re-use of major public research outputs (e.g. publications or datasets) and data processing capabilities, analytical tools or any other added-value quality service from various providers;</li><li>Provide and evolve service management tools that support the provider\u2019s participation to the EOSC federation;</li><li>Foster secure composability of services and interoperability of datasets and other outputs by supporting the use of common interfaces, standards, ICT specifications and best practices that not only allows for services to be reused in multiple service compositions but also ensures the reliability, flexibility and scalability of those services.</li> </ul><p>c. User enhanced experience using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques</p><p>Proposals should describe how the EOSC Portal would be enhanced with AI-based services in order to exploit usage patterns and to advise researchers and other EOSC users on the most suitable EOSC services according to their research profiles and needs. In this way, researchers that have completed their EOSC user profile (including their affiliation, research interests and needs) can get suggestions based on what services other EOSC users with similar interests and access rights have used to address their research needs. The advice will have to be continuously updated, based on the actual activity of the users at the EOSC Portal enhancing quality and improving predictive response to cover evolving needs and ensure engagement. The quality of the advice of such AI-based services should improve with the increase of the number of EOSC users and services available.</p><p>d. Widening the EOSC user base</p><p>Proposals should include strategies and well-defined structures for gathering needs from potential new user communities and propose methods outlining the operational requirements to be satisfied by the EOSC Portal to effectively attract and integrate new users. This includes the possibility of federating and/or integrating heterogeneous and hybrid research clouds into the EOSC Portal.</p><p>In order to enable users from non-research communities to access EOSC services through the EOSC Portal, the AAI<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup> federated architecture implemented in the EOSC Portal should be fully aligned with the legal and interoperability framework set by the eIDAS Regulation<sup><a target=_self href=#fn9 id=r9>[9]</a></sup>.</p><p>Proposals shall include the development of APIs or any other necessary feature that allow third parties such as Open Data Initiatives or other initiatives under the European Common Data Space to become users of the EOSC services and to access the available services in the EOSC Portal from their own environments.</p><p>Proposals should include an outline of the legal, technical and business processes to be implemented through contractual agreements between the EOSC Portal and user institutions that are interested in providing increased accessibility to EOSC services and resources to their affiliated members.</p><p>e. Widening the service offer with commercial services</p><p>Proposals should address both of the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals should incorporate commercial services into the EOSC marketplace and expand it, by building further on the work carried out under the topic INFRAEOSC-01-2018<sup><a target=_self href=#fn10 id=r10>[10]</a></sup> and under the <a href=\"http://www.eosc-hub.eu/\">EOSC-hub</a> project. In particular, proposals should (1) through the EOSC Portal feedback mechanisms<sup><a target=_self href=#fn11 id=r11>[11]</a></sup>, aggregate the various needs of EOSC users for commercial services that are complementary to the services offered by public infrastructures, (2) procure preferably green<sup><a target=_self href=#fn12 id=r12>[12]</a></sup> innovative commercial services addressing the aggregated user demand and (3) make available the purchased services to EOSC users. Proposals will make the procured capacity available for access - together with other capabilities of interest - through the portal access channel. Service capacity shall be allocated to projects and initiatives through a selection process that ensures excellence, fair distribution across scientific communities and removal of digital divides across communities and countries. The procurement mechanism should be compatible with the Green Public Procurement initiative<sup><a target=_self href=#fn13 id=r13>[13]</a></sup>. Examples of commercial services that could be incorporated include commodity type commercial digital services that are necessary for interdisciplinary research activities or secure Earth Observation commercial services stemming from the use of Copernicus open data, etc. The inclusion of such added-value commercial services will enrich the existing catalogue, generate positive impact on cross-disciplinary research activities in the EOSC environment and improve user experience with the overall EOSC service offering. A maximum amount of EUR 10 million of the total budget for this sub-topic is foreseen for this procurement activity.</p> </li><li>Building on the work of the <a href=\"https://www.eosc-hub.eu/\">EOSC-hub </a>project, proposals should collaborate with private sector entities, in particular with SMEs, in the context of digital innovation hubs initiatives, in order to stimulate an ecosystem of innovation and knowledge transfer that fosters the development of commercial services to continuously cover the needs of EOSC users<sup><a target=_self href=#fn11 id=r11>[11]</a></sup>.</li> </ul><p>f. Support activities</p><p>Proposals shall also cover all the following activities aiming at boosting the impact and outreach of the EOSC Portal:</p><p>i. Outreach and skills</p><p>Leveraging on existing networks and actions for training on and outreach of the EOSC and in strong collaboration with the awarded grants under topic INFRAEOSC-07-2020, proposals should include activities to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Foster the EOSC initiative\u2019s uptake and spread both geographically and across scientific disciplines and communities (including long tail of science). Moreover, proposals should include measures and dissemination activities for closing the gap between European countries with higher and lower EOSC uptake, including the EU candidate countries and the Western Balkans.</li><li>Develop the necessary skills of EOSC users for sharing resources, managing data and applying the FAIR principles in the context of the EOSC Portal, by e.g. providing researchers and data practitioners with consolidated cross-infrastructure training packages for data skills, data science and data stewardship.</li> </ul><p>ii. Support to the Research Data Alliance\u2019s contribution to the EOSC:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Proposals retained for funding should directly support the contribution of RDA to the EOSC initiative and, in particular, in the context of the EOSC Portal.</li><li>Proposals should also provide financial support to third parties wishing to engage and participate in the Research Data Alliance processes and activities, including RDA outputs adoption fostering the interoperability and service composition in the EOSC Portal<sup><a target=_self href=#fn15 id=r15>[15]</a></sup>.</li> </ul><p>Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the actions awarded under topic INFRAEOSC-07-2020. The main purpose of the collaboration agreements referred to in Article 41.4 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement</a> is to describe the terms and conditions for the provision of services through the EOSC Portal.</p><p>Grants awarded under this topic will be complementary to the action awarded under topic INFRAEOSC-06-2019 (a) and should conclude a collaboration agreement.</p><p>For grants awarded under this topic, beneficiaries will be subject to the following additional obligations aiming at ensuring exploitation of its results: proposals must necessary state the participants\u2019 commitment to: a) use open source software, b) make tools, standards, specifications and all other relevant outputs generated in the action available, through a well-defined mechanism, to the EOSC governance and any other institution responsible for the continuity of the EOSC Portal beyond the lifespan of the Grant Agreement.</p><p>Grants awarded under this topic are expected to carry out an analysis regarding energy consumption and environmental impact of technologies used in the context of the project. The analysis should include an action plan in order to limit the carbon and energy footprint with a specific reference to the standard EN 50600-4<sup><a target=_self href=#fn16 id=r16>[16]</a></sup> together with a timeline for implementation of the defined milestones and KPIs.</p><p>As the scope of this activity is to consolidate a single EOSC Portal, at most one single proposal covering all the described activities (a. to f. included) is expected to be funded.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 40.9 million and a 30 months duration would allow this challenge to be addressed appropriately.
