This holds for several classes of molecules, such as fluorinates and silanes, used for surface treatment in a number of applications e.g. fluid barrier in packaging, hydrophobic/oleophobic coating, surface protection and visual enhancement of printed products. The market for coating additives is a growing one, due to the desire of increasing shelf life of products, avoid permeation and in general maintain the physical and visual properties of products for a longer time. Bio-based molecules could help solving the environmental concerns of hydrophobic and barrier applications. Moreover bio-based molecules, due to the available variety in their chemical composition, represent versatile alternatives potentially suitable for custom functionalisation. However meeting the required performance in specific applications still represents a challenge.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Development of new functional molecules from lignocellulosic biomass to be used for surface treatment in a number of applications e.g. packaging, coating and printing. The molecules should have a tailored molecular structure in order to fulfil the required functional properties (e.g. hydrophobic, oleophobic, liquid/gas barrier, surface protection) and impose desired properties to modified materials and surfaces or interfaces. Proposals should include an assessment of the potential impact of the introduction of the new processes and products on the environmental, social and economic performance of the whole value chain.</p><p><em>It is considered that proposals with a total eligible budget between EUR 2 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
