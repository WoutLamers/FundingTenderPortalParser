Within this time frame, there is still significant work to carry out to make sure that the multiple technologies contemplated for 5G will meet the full range of service requirements. Early validation with the widest possible footprint of candidate technologies for 5G is hence needed to support global consensus based on \"derisked\" technologies.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Research and Innovation Actions </strong></p><p>The focus of the joint research will be to test and validate technologies currently contemplated for early 5G standardisation, primarily at radio access level but with a clear use case focus. The main goal is to validate technologies supporting 5G KPIs that cannot be addressed by today's existing technologies. Considering the joint interest of Brazil and the EU to use 5G in support of digitisation of vertical business sectors (health care, automotive, smart factories, energy, smart cities, agribusiness, etc.), the work could address specific vertical use case scenarios, namely <strong>massive Machine-type Communications (mMTC)/</strong><strong>Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLL)</strong>. Or it could address <strong>coverage of low population density areas</strong>. For this latter case, validation of spectrum options is in scope.</p><p>The testing and validation of technologies supporting core 5G standards is expected to be carried out through prototypes and user experiments.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The 5G joint EU-Brazil research is intended to support the development of innovative technologies in the context of 5G radio access or core network, to provide solutions for demanding requirements of \"vertical\" sectors or for coverage of low density regions.</p><p>Other impacts include:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>novel contributions on 5G standards in support of global industry consensus,</li>  <li>support and spin off contributions to the ITU/3G PP standardisation roadmaps, e.g. through submission of joint contributions in these fora by EU and Brazilian players,</li>  <li>validation of 5G use cases applicable to low density regions or mMTC/URLL scenarios.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.
