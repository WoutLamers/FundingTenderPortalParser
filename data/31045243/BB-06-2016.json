Few regions in Europe are in the process of building successful \"bio-based industries\" demonstrator case studies. Those that do exist are largely in the regions with established industries (chemical, energy, pulp and paper, etc.).</p><p>Strategies and implementing modalities should be shared in particular with regions that have as yet unexploited biomass or waste resources so as to widen participation of countries, fully exploit the potentials of the bio-based economy in Europe and contribute to rural and coastal renaissance. Bio-based industries and products offer new opportunities for regional and local actors using alternative resources and maximising possibilities for agricultural, forest and urban waste to be valorised. Development of synergies with the regional innovation strategies for the bio-based economy will boost the competitiveness of the region and its stakeholders on a national, European and international level. Local actors may equally attract investments from other partners for establishing a favourable bio-based \"ecosystem\".</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals will create a stakeholder platform of regional and local organisations (regional authorities or mandated agencies or clusters) interested in developing ambitious strategies in support of bio-based products/industries, with the aim to attract new investments in industrial projects. Building on the \"model demonstrator regions\", successful case studies shall be shared and transposed to other interested European regions. Industries, regions and investors should be brought together to establish an efficient dialogue between actors so that demand and supply can be aligned, establishing best practices and examples that can be followed by others.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
