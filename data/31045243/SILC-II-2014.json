Leveraging advanced manufacturing technologies and key enabling technologies through the whole value chain and promoting the adoption of such technologies within and across sectors would help to meet these twin challenges. In particular, in the context of the EU\u2019s decarbonisation ambitions, breakthrough solutions for advanced low-carbon manufacturing and processing are important in maintaining the competitiveness of EU industries.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> Under the SILC II initiative, research and innovation activities for innovative, cost-effective technologies shall be developed in order to reduce the GHG emission intensity (ratio between direct GHG emissions and output units of an activity) of manufacturing and process industries. Proposals will preferably focus on energy-intensive industries, in particular (but not only) those industries which may be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage. Targeted industries include inter alia iron and steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminium and copper, cement, glass, pulp and paper, chemicals and ceramics.</p><p>Proposals shall focus on research and innovation for the design and development of breakthrough solutions and implementation of demonstration programmes, including in real industrial environments. The activities should run close-to-market in production plants to demonstrate the viability of breakthrough technologies in overcoming the technological as well as non-technological barriers. Proposals will address technological solutions that could have widespread applications and may combine different technologies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The reduction of GHG emissions should not be achieved solely through fuel switching.</p><p>For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposed project.</p><p>Wherever possible, proposers could actively seek synergies, including possibilities for funding, with relevant national / regional research and innovation programmes and/or cumulative funding with European Structural and Investment Funds in connection with smart specialisation strategies. For this purpose the tools provided by the Smart Specialization Platform, Eye@RIS3 may be useful[1]. The initial exploitation and business plans will address such synergies and/or additional funding. Exploitation plans, outline financial arrangements and any follow-up will be developed further during the project. The results of these activities as well as the envisaged further activities in this respect should be described in the final report of the project.</p><p>A dedicated work package should address the transferability of the developed technologies within the sector and possibly to other sectors.</p><p>Activities are intended to start at Technology Readiness Levels 4-5 and target Technology Readiness Level 6-7; and are expected to be led by industries involving research partners and technology providers.</p><p><i>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU around EUR 5 - 10 million and with a duration of up to five years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.</i></p><p><u>Expected impact:</u></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Economically viable solutions and technologies allowing an ambitious reduction in specific GHG emission intensity of at least 35%, with respect to the best available techniques currently installed<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The transferability of the solutions and technologies within the sector and possibly to other sectors should be assessed.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reducing the compliance costs of the EU ETS and making EU industry more competitive while avoiding any unwanted distortions between Member States.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Boosting Europe's industrial leadership in advanced manufacturing and processing and fostering employment and opening new market opportunities in this field.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Innovation Actions (50% funding exceptionally).</p><p>[1] http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu; the relevant Managing Authorities can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/indexes/in_your_country_en.cfm</p><p>[2] The best available techniques are those defined in the relevant Best Available Techniques Reference Documents and which are in line with the benchmarks set in the Benchmarking Decision.
