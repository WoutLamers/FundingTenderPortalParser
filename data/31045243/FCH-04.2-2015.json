Knowledgeable and capable workforce that understands the functioning of both technology and underlying fundamental processes, but knows also about obstacles and technological restrictions, is essential for successful development, planning and implementation of FCH plant and system technology. Apart from conventional education and training methods, education and training on FCH technology and its fundamental processes should turn towards digital based e-education and e-training methods, which become more and more used fruitful and successful in modern education methods. In addition, e-science practised by modelling and simulation of very different technological problems and issues is increasing over the past years and knowledge, and results originated by modelling and simulation are available via digital means and should be transferred to be used for education and training on FCH technologies. An envisaged challenge is the presentation of conventional technological content through modern information technology concepts, serviceable for higher education (undergraduate and graduate students) in case of educating engineers but also focusing on industry, especially SMEs, to educate and train permanent employees, or by self-study through new e-education methods and concepts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The scope on this topic encompasses the development of new digital based methods to educate and train undergraduate and graduate students but also technical workforce on FCH technologies and fundamental processes behind. The e-learning concept shall include new methods based on figurative language and representations to explain detailed physical and mathematical principles and FCH technique in its complex structure. Opportunities to support conventional student lessons shall be included as well as concepts for successful self-studies.</p><p>The needed IT-structure shall be built on a web-based e-learning platform backed by open access software, and shall provide free access as a minimum during project lifetime. As several e-learning platforms, databases and digital education material already exist, the e-learning platform shall link others and include comprehensive information on educational and scientific activities in FCH-thematic area to profit from. In addition, user interfaces shall be envisaged to expand the e-learning platform also to e-science, e.g. through modelling and simulation of fundamental processes but also process modelling and simulation of technological and safety aspects. International collaboration with similar activities ongoing in US, Canada and Asia will be an advantage and can strengthen the whole FCH community.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Development of new digital based methods and concepts to educate and train engineers and technicians on FCH technologies</li>  <li>Inclusion of figurative language and representations to support and/or explain detailed physical and mathematical principles behind the technologies (e.g. thermodynamics of hydrogen behaviour, electrochemical behaviour of fuel cells)</li>  <li>Inclusion of digital opportunities to transpose self-study on FCH technologies on different levels</li>  <li>Inclusion of virtual practicing measures to educate and motivate candidates, e.g. e-learning by doing (e.g. through virtual practicing and simple demonstration tools)</li>  <li>Interconnections with already existing e-learning platforms and digital training materials (e.g. digital lessons scripts, digital training materials, databases to specific data)</li>  <li>Provision of freely accessible e-learning platform (e.g. web-based) implementing education and training methods and concepts developed based on open access software</li>  <li>Provision of tools to maintain and update e-learning platform</li>  <li>Development of a business model and structure to ensure that the e-learning platform remains a valuable asset and continues to grow after the initial project(s) is/are completed</li>  <li>Supporting FCH industry by e-education and e-training of permanent staff in general</li>  <li>Strengthen the community by building networks for educational and informational reasons</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><em><u>Other Information: </u></em><br />\r\n<u><em>Indicative funding: </em></u>The FCH 2 JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
