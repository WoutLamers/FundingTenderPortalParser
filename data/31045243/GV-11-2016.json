It calls for a Coordination and Support Action to assist ERTRAC, the European Technology Platform for road transport, the European Green Vehicle Initiative PPP, the European Commission and Member States in defining the research needs for their strategies and programmes in order to achieve the objectives of the Energy Union and other European policies and further on the vision of the White Paper 2011 for a competitive and resource-efficient future transport system.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should consider a comprehensive approach ranging from components to system integration and including enabling technologies and other transport modes, where relevant. They should address all the following aspects:</p><p>\u2015Updating of research agendas and roadmaps as developed by the European Technology Platform ERTRAC (European Road Transport Research Advisory Council) and the European Green Vehicle Initiative (EGVI).</p><p>\u2015Monitoring of road transport research projects and their impacts from relevant European programmes (Horizon2020, ENT, JU, etc.) and organisation of workshops to present and discuss results, trends, exchange experience and foster innovation aspects.</p><p>\u2015Definition of multi-annual and more precise annual implementation plans as input for the programmes of the EU and Member States.</p><p>\u2015Identification of actions to support education, training, standardisation and business models.</p><p>\u2015Identification of barriers for the deployment of research results and improvement of framework conditions.</p><p>\u2015Fostering of the links between ERTRAC and the national technology platforms for road transport existing at national level in Europe.</p><p>\u2015Organisation of dissemination activities for ERTRAC and EGVI. These activities should also target emerging economies within Asia and Latin America.</p><p>\u2015Facilitating exchange between cities in Europa, Asia and Latin America, initiate pilot actions and develop pre-feasibility studies for cities in emerging economies, and twin EU and international projects on urban electric mobility.</p><p>\u2015Track global progress on urban electric mobility and support UN activities, such as the Urban Electric Mobility Initiative (UEMI).</p><p>The implementation requires close collaboration with the leading stakeholders in transport RTD in Europe. This includes Original Equipment Manufacturers, supply industry, research and engineering organisations, as well as other multipliers such as ETPs dealing with transport research and innovation, EGVI, the ENT, the EU, and Member States. In line with the strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>, international cooperation is encouraged with key emerging countries, in particular China and Brazil.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 to 3.5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>This action will bring together the leading European stakeholders in road transport research to monitor projects, develop roadmaps, and support their implementation. It will contribute to a further harmonisation of research and innovation, and therefore contribute to the European Research Area, in particular also in the view of innovation, as well as to the European strategies for a future transport system. The action will also accelerate time to market of new mobility solutions. In addition, this initiative will contribute to climate action and sustainable development objectives.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&amp;I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) and will be implemented by the Commission services.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs)</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EGVI</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>COM(2012)497</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"> </span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
