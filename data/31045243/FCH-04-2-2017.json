Significant introduction of hydrogen vehicles requires a scale up of two orders of magnitude hydrogen truck distribution. At the same time developing and deploying a high volume trailer is necessary to address both the H2 Mobility market but also the industrial market to increase the volume transported so as to decrease transportation cost and CO2 emissions in a context of increasing fuel cost; to increase customer autonomy and storage footprint and to reduce the HRS investments and ease the ramp up of first stations [1].</p><p>Current standards, regulations and safety codes have been developed for a relatively small market volume and deliveries mostly to industrial sites. These standards need to be reviewed, and adapted if needed, to ensure safe, efficient and low-cost hydrogen delivery at larger scales and in residential areas. These regulations and standards need to be harmonised across Europe.</p><p><em>[1] From DeliverHy \u2013 Recommendations to Industry (http://www.fch.europa.eu/project/optimisation-transport-solutions-compressed-hydrogen)</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The following specific issues should be addressed by the project:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Identify and quantify the risks associated with compressed hydrogen delivery on a large scale, taking into account the whole chain from filling of trucks at a terminal, driving from supplier to customer and delivery of hydrogen at a retail station or other customers;</li>  <li>Propose mitigation actions for the most critical risks;</li>  <li>Provide a roadmap for standardisation of compressed hydrogen trucks and interfaces between the truck and the supply and customer sites that balance safety aspects with commercial, environmental and feasibility aspects.
