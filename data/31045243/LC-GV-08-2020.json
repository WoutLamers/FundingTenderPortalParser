As cities become bigger and smarter, this trend leads to new opportunities for specialised vehicle designs, more specific to urban users\u2019 including commuter\u2019s needs and operations and last mile delivery. New vehicle architectures should lead to flexibility and modularity in order to ensure urban-readiness (appropriate range, compatibility with charging infrastructures, ease of parking and operations) in all kind of urban and sub-urban areas, most likely with different implementation levels of infrastructure and smart technologies. Additionally, it is assumed that these vehicles do not need to be designed for high-speed operation and long range, and can be easily charged sufficiently fast and comfortably to meet the daily needs of urban and suburban mobility usage scenarios, which may also include sharing concepts. Consideration can be also given to usability by elderly and disabled persons.</p><p>The targeted vehicles will cover small and light vehicles following the design principle of right-sizing vehicles for their mission. These will all satisfy performance targets such as improved efficiency during urban usage or control strategies based on data from traffic flow monitoring or prediction systems, as well as integration into the sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) of the respective urban areas, with more effective use of parking spaces and possible decreased urban congestion, including demands arising for mobility and logistics across functional urban boundaries, e. g. urban to suburban.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should address only <strong>one</strong> of the following subtopics (except in the case of modular concepts capable of addressing subtopics 2 and 3 respectively with the same platform</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Urban light personal mobility - The success of vehicles such as monowheels, electric scooters and hoverboards suggests to explore innovative microvehicle designs suitable for urban/sub-urban dweller and commuter\u2019 needs with the option for usage within shared mobility schemes.\u200bThese vehicles will be aimed at improving specific urban usage needs such as decreased congestion, elimination of parking and recharging need in case weight and volume are low enough to allow the user to carry them at all times. Such microvehicles would also have the capability of interfacing with urban collective transport systems (i.e. easy access to buses, trams and trains for \u201clast mile\u201d transfers to achieve full intermodality). Concepts to improve safety of users and of pedestrians (if these vehicles were used on sidewalks) are an added bonus. The proposals should develop a solution up to TRL 8-9 and must include a detailed exploitation strategy and a draft business plan for the product to be developed. The proposers should demonstrate their capacity to have a market ready product by the end of the project. Regulatory aspects shall also be covered, in particular about the integration of these new concepts in road codes.</li><li>Light and flexible multipassenger vehicles (e.g. collective or individual, owned or shared up to M1 category) with high safety for passengers and vulnerable road users and specific features to facilitate shared use such as autonomous-capable vehicles with automated relocation to charging points or areas with insufficient vehicle density. An added dimension of flexibility and modularity (e.g. including reconfigurable interiors) can also be considered to support the ability to adapt and upgrade in order to move from one application to the next, and cater, if relevant, to the needs of different users and uses as required for shared mobility scenarios). Gender aspects should be considered in the design of the vehicles, when relevant, for instance in the case of crashworthiness.</li><li>Rightsized vehicles for commercial uses (up to N1 category) such as last-/first-mile delivery, construction and maintenance support (masons, plumbers, HVAC technicians etc.), that are suitable specifically for urban scenarios. Affordability will be aimed at achieving an acceptable acquisition cost and significantly lower operational expenditure while specific tailoring to particular urban usage needs will aim at ensuring high transportation and charging efficiency and optimised land use (e.g. \u201cright-power\u201d DC-charging at pre-defined locations - home base, customer/delivery points etc. - might be sufficient).</li> </ol><p>For all these subtopics, fully integrated safety should be considered as a priority, including crash resistance (in case of three and four wheels urban vehicles) providing equivalent occupant safety and vulnerable road user protection as the M1/N1 vehicle they would replace; in the case of micro vehicles, safety innovation should be targeted at reducing their vulnerability in traffic.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million for sub-topic 1 and of between EUR 4 and 6 million for sub-topic 2 and 3 would allow the specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\"><li>For completely new microvehicle concepts and configurations (subtopic 1), proposers should demonstrate benefits on a mission/range basis in comparison to current types (monowheels, hoverboard, e-bikes or electric scooters) as appropriate in the foreseen applications.</li><li>Next generation vehicles concepts in sub-topics 2) and 3) shall demonstrate in real testing ambitious targets of up to 10% energy efficiency improvement in comparison with existing electric vehicles of the same class.</li><li>Price will be on a par with current vehicles used for similar missions (minicars, vans of similar payload to be used as benchmarks for subtopic 2 and 3, while current hoverboards and scooters are the benchmark for subtopic1).</li><li>These vehicles will inherently benefit local air quality and promise rapid implementation due to their holistic and design-for-purpose approach.</li><li>The perception of low safety of the smaller categories of vehicles should be dispelled by proving their resistance in crash (on real vehicles, achieving EURONCAP 4 star car crash standards for subtopics 2 and 3). Lower probability of having an accident is a desired but not mandatory outcome for subtopic 1.</li><li>Increased acceptance of single purpose design vehicles is expected due to physical demonstration of the feasibility (both technical and economical) of equivalent or superior performance, upgradeability and operational safety in relevant environment particularly for light and flexible transport.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=CleanEnergy;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Clean Energy</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs)</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EGVI</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer-2015/global/urban-world\">http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer-2015/global/urban-world</a></p>", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>1.

Awareness of the ever growing impact of noxious and particulate emissions on health and significant progress in battery technology and production will lead to an acceleration of their market penetration. In addition to the specific call on <strong>'Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: Next\u2013Generation Batteries\u2019 </strong>which will address issues related to the necessary advances in electric batteries, the present call will focus on other critical aspects supporting a massive introduction of electrified vehicles: 1) new architectures, concepts and components to support the advent of the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation of electrified vehicles, 2) improve the recharging experience from the view-point of the end-users, 3) supporting the competitiveness of European industries through the development of digitalised production environments and the use of advanced material, 4) addressing the urban dimension of introducing electrified vehicles. This call addresses only road transport.</p><p>As already mentioned, topics addressing issues related to the development of the next generation of electric batteries, which contribute to the EU Battery Alliance, are found in the dedicated cross-cutting Call <strong>'Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: Next\u2013Generation Batteries\u2019 </strong>which is in part 20 \u201cCross-cutting activities\u201d of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020<strong>. </strong>Topics of particular relevance to the \u2018Smart, green and integrated transport\u2019 Challenge in that Call are: LC-BAT-1-2019: Strongly improved, highly performant and safe all solid state batteries for electric vehicles; LC-BAT-5-2019: Research and innovation for advanced Li-ion cells (generation 3b); LC-BAT-6-2019: Li-ion Cell Materials &amp; Transport Modelling; and LC-BAT-7-2019: Network of Li-ion cell pilot lines. Research under these topics will contribute to the creation of a European knowledge and industrial base that will support the development of electromobility applications in transport.</p><p><em>The strategic objective of the Green Vehicles Calls for proposals for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 will be to prepare the ground for this potential massive increase of electrified vehicles and to support European industries to maintain their leading world position in supplying automotive products. The major impact of the research will be to promote the development of a new generation of electric vehicles with a minimum of 400 km range that meets customer expectations, progress and demonstration in urban and regional electric vehicles (light and smart vehicles for passengers, delivery vehicles and buses) and support the production of components and electrified vehicles in Europe. Wide user acceptance shall be stimulated by accessibility and ease of use of all types of charging infrastructure \u2013 public, semi-public and private.</em></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:15:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2020 9:15:48 PM", "content": "<p>On 28 April 2020, a total of 70 full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2020 topics:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nLC-GV-06-2020 (IA) &ndash; 39 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-07-2020 (IA) &ndash; 2 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-08-2020 (IA) &ndash; 28 proposals <br />\r\nLC-GV-09-2020 (CSA) &ndash; 1 proposal </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:22:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 7, 2020 2:22:20 PM", "content": "<p>Reacting to the Covid-19 crisis, the submission deadline for the following topics has been extended to 28 April 2020 17:00:00 Brussels time:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLC-GV-06-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-07-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-08-2020 (IA)<br />\r\nLC-GV-09-2020 (CSA)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 3, 2019 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-08-2020(IA), LC-GV-06-2020(IA), LC-GV-07-2020(IA), LC-GV-09-2020(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:12:20 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 29, 2019 11:12:20 AM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 12pt;\">On 25 April 2019, a total of 27&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2019 topics:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-03-2019&ndash; 19 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-04-2019&ndash; 3 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-05-2019&ndash; 5 proposals<o:p></o:p></span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 4, 2018 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-03-2019(IA), LC-GV-05-2019(IA), LC-GV-04-2019(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:52:50 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2018 7:52:50 PM", "content": "<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">On 4 April 2018, a total of 34&nbsp;full proposals were submitted in response to the following 2018 topics:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-01-2018 &ndash; 18 proposals <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB\">LC-GV-02-2018 &ndash; 16 proposals&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:21:15 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 1, 2018 6:21:15 PM", "content": "<div><strong>IMPORTANT - Page limits applicable to proposals:</strong></div>\r\n<div>Applicants are allowed to remove the page break in the cover page of the template for the technical annex, i.e. the proposal text can start on the cover page.</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:34:14 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 31, 2017 12:34:14 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LC-GV-01-2018(IA), LC-GV-02-2018(RIA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
