These problems call for innovative and creative solutions for building integrated photovoltaic that must combine aesthetic and photovoltaic technology applied in historical buildings that represent the artistic and cultural heritage of a city.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This inducement prize will reward a European protected historic urban district that has perfectly integrated in its buildings a photovoltaic system to generate and supply electricity for its own consumption. In this context the photovoltaic system includes all the necessary components to supply power within a district.</p><p>The prize will induce the integration of new photovoltaic systems in protected historic urban districts. It will also foster the development of the best suitable architectural and aesthetic design in combination with optimal technical solutions delivering the least visible impact and a minimal intrusion to the structure of the buildings. The prize aims as well to mobilise and enhance private and public investment for replication of similar solutions in Europe.</p><p>The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.</p><p>Indicative prize amount: EUR 0.75 million.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The prize winner will be the entrant (a community) that has installed and operated in the protected historic urban district in Europe a new building integrated photovoltaic system (BIPV) to provide electricity corresponding to at least 50% of the required electricity consumption of the district. The suggested energy solution shall be adaptable and replicable to other districts. Clear energy security and economic benefits shall be attained to assure replications.</p><p>It is expected that the prize will accelerate the innovation in photovoltaic technologies and architectural enhancement needed for sustainable use of European protected historic urban districts. Integrating photovoltaics in this type of districts will create new industrial expertise. It will also give a good opportunity to local small and medium-sized enterprises to develop new ideas and demonstrate their know-how.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting pilot activities is excluded from the delegation to INEA and will be implemented by the Commission services.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </strong></span>described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-pv-history_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">     </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Eligibility and exclusion criteria:</span></strong> described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-pv-history_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><br />\r\n    </em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the application template.<em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Evaluation and award criteria and procedure:</span></strong> described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-pv-history_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>&nbsp;Indicative timetable for evaluation and award of prizes: </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-pv-history_en.pdf\">Rules for Contest</a>.</span> <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li>A<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>pplication templates and evaluation forms for prizes under this topic:</strong></span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Application template for inducement prizes&nbsp;is available after entering the submission tool below.<u><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_at/h2020-prizes-induc-at-pv-history_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for inducement prizes</a></u><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>Additional provisions:</strong></span> described in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-pv-history_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong><br />\r\n    The general rules for Prizes</strong></span> are described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-f-prizes_en.pdf\">part F of the General Annexes of the Work Programme</a>.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Additional documents</span></strong>:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a>  <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-euratom-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Euratom Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme</a> <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;
