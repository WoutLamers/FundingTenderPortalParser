A combination of rapid, accurate and specific diagnostics and correct treatment promises not only to reduce caseloads of multi-drug resistant infections, but also to limit public spending for necessary isolation and hospitalisation by early and correctly identifying the appropriate treatment. In practice however, cost issues hamper the implementation of rapid diagnostics for ID in public health institutions, as innovative rapid diagnostics are still significantly more expensive than culture-based diagnostics. This issue and the lack of consideration of total cost of care limits the uptake of innovative rapid diagnostics in hospitals, which could result in a continued unspecific use of antimicrobials, prolonged hospitalisations and a non-patient centred provision of care.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic will contribute to the EU One Health Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and should specifically consider the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Development of proposals for \u2018Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions\u2019 for the implementation of rapid diagnostic tools for infectious diseases in clinical practice. Proposals should be driven by clearly identified procurement needs of the participating organisations. In order to ensure compatibility and interoperability between infectious disease diagnostics and avoid technical/technology standardisation issues, public health procurers should also develop specifications that are applicable for EU-wide deployment of the innovative diagnostics.</li><li>Applications should be driven by public and/or private procurers from each participating country (at national, regional or local level) that have responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of supply of health and care services. They should demonstrate the applicability of the \u2018Most Economically Advantageous Tendering\u2019 approach in cross-border collaboration of public procurers in the EU, defining specific outcome criteria of importance for patients well-being, and for innovation of public procurement in the area of infectious diseases and AMR, taking also into account overall economic and societal benefits, and sex and gender differences when relevant..</li><li>Proposals should include clear communication and outreach strategies aiming to actively promote and support public health procurement organisations and health care providers across regions and borders of the EU in adopting relevant innovation procurement approaches. They should specify measures that will ensure the sustainability of solutions beyond the lifespan of the proposed project.</li><li>Synergies with the Structural Reform Support Program and the European Structural and Investment Fund are encouraged.</li> </ul><p>Activities covered should include cooperation with policy makers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for PCP and PPI, searching support and collaborating with respective coordination and networking projects, e.g. PIPPI and HCO-12. Likewise, awareness raising, technical assistance and/or capacity building beyond the project to mainstream PPI implementation and removing obstacles for introducing the innovative solutions to be procured into the market could be included.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
