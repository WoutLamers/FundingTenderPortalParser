A complete proposal entails all parts or sections (see 'Proposal page limits and layout' below). Incomplete proposals may be declared ineligible. The content of the proposal must relate to the objectives and to the grant type set out in the call, as defined in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/erc/h2020-wp16-erc_en.pdf\">ERC Work Programme 2016</a>.

An overview is provided below: <br />\r\nEvaluation procedure<br />\r\nA single submission of the full proposal will be followed by a two-step evaluation. The evaluation will be conducted by means of a structure of high level peer review panels as listed in Annex 1 of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/erc/h2020-wp16-erc_en.pdf\">ERC Work Programme 2016</a>. The panels may be assisted by independent experts working remotely.<br />\r\nEvaluation criteria <br />\r\nFor all ERC frontier research grants, excellence is the sole criterion of evaluation. It will be applied in conjunction to the evaluation of both: the ground-breaking nature, ambition and feasibility of the research project; and the intellectual capacity, creativity and commitment of the Principal Investigator. The detailed evaluation elements applying to the excellence of the research project and the Principal Investigator are set out in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/erc/h2020-wp16-erc_en.pdf\">ERC Work Programme 2016</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: #000080\"><strong>3.2 Guide to the submission and evaluation process</strong></span><strong>:</strong> please refer to the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/sgl/erc/h2020-erc-se-rules-amended_en.pdf\">ERC Rules for Submission and Evaluation</a>.

Open access:</strong></span> the ERC supports the principle of open access to the published output of research, including in particular peer-reviewed articles and monographs, as a fundamental part of its mission. It also supports the basic principle of open access to research data and data related products such as computer code. The ERC considers that providing free online access to all these materials can be the most effective way of ensuring that the fruits of the research it funds can be accessed, read and used as the basis for further research. Under Horizon 2020, beneficiaries of ERC grants must ensure open access to all peer-reviewed scientific publications relating to its results. The detailed requirements on open access to publications are contained in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/erc/h2020-mga-erc-mono_en.pdf\">Horizon 2020 ERC Model Grant Agreement</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<p><a href=\"mailto:ERC-2016-COG-APPLICANTS@ec.europa.eu\">ERC 2016 Consolidator Grant Applicant Mailbox</a> - For any queries related to the call<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/h2020-faq16-erc-cog_en.pdf\">ERC 2016 Consolidator Grant Frequently Asked Questions</a> </span>(FAQs)<br />\r\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000\"><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html#f11\">Participant Portal FAQ </a></span>&ndash; Submission of proposals<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html\">National Contact Points (NCP)</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?lg=en&amp;pg=enquiries\">Research Enquiry Service</a> &ndash; ask questions about any aspect of European research and EU R&amp;I programmes<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/api/contact/index.html\">IT Helpdesk</a> &ndash; contact the IT helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc.<br />\r\nEthics &ndash; for compliance with ethical issues, see the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/ethics_en.htm\">Participant Portal</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/index.cfm?pg=policy&amp;lib=ethics\">Science and Society Portal</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/\">European IPR Helpdesk</a> &ndash; assists you on intellectual property issues<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/pdf/brochure_rights/am509774CEE_EN_E4.pdf\">The European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal4/desktop/en/funding/guide.html\">H2020 Online Manual </a>&ndash; your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>", "sepTemplate": "<p>To access the Electronic Submission Service of the topic, please select the <strong>type of action</strong> that is most relevant to your proposal from the list below and click on the <strong>'Start Submission' </strong>button.
