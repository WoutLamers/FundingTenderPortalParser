Copernicus data and information are mainly made available on a free open and full basis. This is expected to unleash unique market opportunities. It is important to foster market development exploiting the added value of integration of EO observation technologies (both satellite, airborne and ground based) with positioning ones and ICT (enhancing new frontiers opened by web) across different market segments through the development of applications, and encourage their insertion into the market.</p><p>For such applications and developments to succeed in the market, the product needs to be shaped according to users\u2019 needs and their value to users must be openly demonstrated to the wider user community. This needs to be achieved in an environment integrated at the level of the user, in order for users to accept the innovative potential which the product promises. This will require also specific attention to be given to the various processes in place in the users\u2019 workflows which incorporate the EO information. Furthermore, the transition of R&amp;D product prototypes to viable commercial product lines after the end of the EU funded phase remains a challenge to be addressed early on during product development. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals may address a wide variety of applications stemming from the use of Earth observation and its smart integration with other related technologies. Copernicus should be considered as part of the solution which may include other space or non-space inputs. This is likely to lead to greater value, opportunities and especially market uptake. To this aim, a business model, which includes the phase of the project following the end of the public funding, should be part of the proposal.</p><p>The outcome of this innovation project should be a commercial service platform, sustained by a production process capable to deliver to the user a product which is validated and accepted as a marketable product. Transnational collaboration has a key role to play in this context, as it enhances access to markets beyond the national borders, notably by enabling space application providers to absorb market-related tacit knowledge and know-how of their partners. Corresponding validations and customisations are to be undertaken, and the business case for the application is to be demonstrated. Service level models are to be developed, with appropriate quality of service definitions for the application. Application products are expected to adopt open standards for data documentation, data models and services including data processing, visualisation and cataloguing.</p><p>The choice of EO application is left to the proposer.</p><p>Applicants are advised to consult further information on availability of Copernicus Sentinel Data, access to Copernicus Contributing Mission data, as well as issues recommended to be detailed in the proposals at the Commission\u2019s website<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Establish sustainable supply chains for innovative EO value added products and services with demonstrated commercial value with targeted client communities.

Activities under the Leadership in Industrial Technologies part focus on the evolution of Copernicus and the exploitation of existing European space infrastructure by promoting the development of innovative products and services based on remote sensing, geo-positioning or other types of satellite enabled data as well as geo-information generated already by services such as Copernicus services.</p><p>Moreover, taking into account the wider relevance of EO to all parts of Horizon 2020, proposals addressing application and uptake of EO for the development of innovative applications addressing specific challenges can also be submitted to the Horizon 2020 Societal Challenges where related references are included. To that end, applicants to those parts of Horizon 2020 can also access Copernicus data and information (licensing conditions may apply)[[Access to Copernicus Sentinel data and service information is provided to users on a free, full and open basis. For other satellites data, the DataWareHouse document 2.0 is available at <a href=\"http://www.copernicus.eu/main/library/technical-documents/\">http://www.copernicus.eu/main/library/technical-documents/</a> and licensing details can be consulted at <a href=\"http://gmesdata.esa.int/web/gsc/dap_document\">http://gmesdata.esa.int/web/gsc/dap_document</a> as well as <a href=\"http://gmesdata.esa.int/web/gsc/terms_and_conditions\">http://gmesdata.esa.int/web/gsc/terms_and_conditions</a>.]].</p><p>To facilitate access to opportunities for applicants, the following list includes dedicated Earth observation activities in calls in other work programme parts, in addition to those in this call:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Blue Growth \u2013 demonstrating an ocean of opportunities (H2020-BG-2016-2017):   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>BG-9-2016: An integrated Arctic observing system</li>    <li>BG-12-2016: Towards an integrated Mediterranean Sea Observing System</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Sustainable Food Security \u2013 resilient agri-food chains (H2020-SFS-2016-2017):   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>SFS-43-2017: Earth Observation services for the monitoring of agricultural production in Africa</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Climate Action, Environment, Resource Efficiency and Raw Materials - Earth Observation (H2020-SC5-2016-2017):   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>SC5-18-2017 - Novel in-situ observation systems</li>    <li>SC5-19-2017 - Coordination of citizens' observatories initiatives</li>    <li>SC5-20-2016 - European data hub of the GEOSS information system</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Earth Observation (H2020-EO-2016 and H2020-EO-2017)   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>EO-1-2016 and EO-1-2017: Downstream applications</li>    <li>EO-2-2016: Downstream applications for public sector users</li>    <li>EO-3-2016: Evolution of Copernicus services</li>    <li>EO-2-2017: EO Big Data Shift</li>    <li>EO-3-2017: Preparation for a European capacity to monitor CO2 anthropogenic emissions</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Competitiveness of the European Space Sector: Technology and Science (H2020-COMPET-2017)   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>COMPET-2-2017: Competitiveness in Earth observation mission technologies</li>   </ul> </li>  <li>SME Instrument (H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017), although not dedicated uniquely to Earth Observation, is particularly well suited for SMEs addressing space based applications   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>SMEInst-04-2016-2017: Engaging SMEs in space research and development</li>    <li>SMEInst-12-2016-2017: Boosting the potential of small businesses in the areas and priorities of Societal Challenge 5</li>   </ul> </li> </ul>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 29, 2016 1:58:24 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 29, 2016 1:58:24 PM", "content": "<p>An overview of the evaluation results (flash call info) is now available under the tab &quot;Topic conditions and documents&quot;&nbsp;(Additional documents) in each topic section.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 4, 2016 9:50:40 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 4, 2016 9:50:40 AM", "content": "<p>A total of <strong>62 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is shown below:<br />\r\n&bull; EO-1-2016: 30 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; EO-2-2016: 2 proposals<br />\r\n&bull; EO-3-2016: 30 proposals<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The evaluation of the proposals, including an ethics screening, is planned to start on the 11th of April and will be closed on the 20th of June 2016.
