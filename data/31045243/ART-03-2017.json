In the past years, there have been significant efforts to develop the required technologies for platooning. However, substantial challenges remain on the path to a Europe wide deployment of platooning, such as platooning with different types of vehicles in real, mixed traffic conditions, better understanding the requirements with regard to logistics, data exchange, sharing of cost savings or the perception and behaviour of other road users in presence of road trains and automated heavy duty vehicles, for instance at motorway exits.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The focus of this topic is to develop, test and validate platooning concepts, technologies and functionalities and to demonstrate the robustness of multi-brand platooning using C-ITS communication on a real corridor use case (which preferably goes across national borders). The proposed actions should include all the following aspects:</p><p>\u2015Solutions to ensure robustness, reliability and interoperability of the platoon operation in real road conditions.</p><p>\u2015Automated mechanisms to support transition from single automated vehicles to platoons.</p><p>\u2015Supporting models for forming and dissolution of platoons (with different vehicles from different manufacturers).</p><p>\u2015Analysis of different platooning strategies (incl. logistical optimisation) to achieve good cost-benefits.</p><p>\u2015Integration with intelligent traffic and logistical information systems.</p><p>\u2015Suitable lane assignment strategies for platoons.</p><p>\u2015Design of road interfaces between corridors for platooning and non-adapted roads and optimisation of road infrastructure to optimally support platooning (technical, capacity, management).</p><p>\u2015Analysis of road users\u2019 perceptions of and behavioural reactions to platoons and their behaviour, impact of road trains on traffic and transport infrastructure, legal/regulatory challenges and standards.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 15 to 20 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Actions are expected to address the challenges that remain on the path to a Europe wide deployment of platooning with different types of vehicles in real, mixed traffic conditions. They will seek to demonstrate the feasibility of robust, reliable and interoperable multi-brand platooning systems on a real corridor use case. Actions will show that multi-brand platooning will help to increase energy efficiency of heavy duty traffic in platoons by about 15%, improve traffic management due to more efficient utilisation of road capacity, as well as: safety of heavy duty vehicles in mixed traffic. Therefore, actions will contribute to the development of modern, more efficient transport systems, with reduced impacts on climate change, air pollution, noise, health and accidents. Actions will also seek to reach a total cost reduction of logistics and supply chain leading to improved competitiveness of the EU in general and contribute to increased competitiveness of European Original Equipment Manufacturers and supply industry.</p><p>Actions will provide significant contributions in the following areas:</p><p>\u2015Analyse impacts of platooning on traffic.</p><p>\u2015Study perception and behaviour of other road users in presence of road trains and automated heavy duty vehicles, for instance at motorway exits.</p><p>\u2015Analyse requirements with regard to infrastructure to optimally support platooning, logistics, data exchange, sharing of cost savings.</p><p>\u2015Understand innovative business cases for operators (for example due to the impact on driving time and rest periods of drivers).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

It holds the promise to help address many of the major challenges of today's transport system, such as user safety, energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, air quality and congestion, and to enhance the drivers' individual comfort and convenience. At the same time, it represents a critical testing ground for the ability of the European automotive industry to preserve and consolidate its global leadership. Automakers around the world are unanimous in predicting the emergence of systems for automated driving sometime in the near future.</p><p>Current technology will evolve further towards semi-automation and eventually towards full automation in real moving traffic. This evolution is very promising and may help to drastically reduce road fatalities to near zero, as more than 90% of road accidents are partly or fully due to human errors. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges related to technology, digital infrastructure, user and societal acceptance, driver behaviour, regulation and legislation, and business models, which need to be tackled to enable the deployment of automated driving on European roads.</p><p>The main contribution of this call will be to support the short term introduction of passenger cars automated driving level 3 (Conditional Automation - Full driving performed by an automated driving system with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene in real traffic conditions)[[The SAE International's standard J3016 identifies six levels of driving automation from \"no automation\" to \"full automation\"]] including safe stops, and of truck platooning in real traffic conditions from 2020 onwards. The main focus of this call is on demonstrations of automated driving systems for passenger cars, trucks and urban transport. Demonstrations will be complemented by further research on digital infrastructure to ensure the necessary level of safety, reliability and efficiency of automated driving systems and by a comprehensive analysis of safety aspects in relation to mixed traffic conditions and their influence on end user acceptance. This call includes also an action to assess road infrastructure requirements for higher levels of vehicle automation and to coordinate and support all research and innovation activities on automated driving both at European and international levels.</p><p>Cooperative systems and connectivity, based on communication of real-time vehicle data, as important means to increase the performance of automated driving will also be addressed in other calls, such as Mobility for Growth (topic MG-6.2-2016 on 'Large-scale demonstration(s) of cooperative ITS'). There is considerable complementarity between the development and deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems and that of Automated Road Transport. ICT components e.g. sensors and microsystems and data fusion which are important elements of automated road transport will be addressed in the LEIT/ICT Work Programme, as well as in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. The 'Internet of Things' call [Work Programme Part Cross-cutting activities (Focus Areas) \u2013 Annex 20] addresses a pilot on 'Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment' which focuses on technology research in a broader IoT context, including horizontal elements such as ethics and privacy, trust and security, validation, standards and interoperability, user acceptability and human factor, liability and sustainability. There is also complementarity with the LEIT/Space Work Programme part, in particular with the call 'Applications in Satellite Navigation \u2013 Galileo', topic 'Galileo-1-2017 \u2013 EGNSS Transport'.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 28, 2017 12:06:47 PM", "content": "<p>On 27 September 2017 a total of 7 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 21, 2017 4:37:51 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2017 two-stage topics (Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the Generalised Feedback for the first stage of 2017 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 30, 2017 11:54:09 AM", "content": "<p><br />\r\nOn 26 January 2017 a total of 22 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>ART-01-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;14 proposals<br />\r\nART-03-2017 &ndash; 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-07-2017 &ndash;&nbsp;6 proposals</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 30, 2016 6:29:26 PM", "content": "<p>On 29 September 2016 a total of 11 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nART-02-2016 &ndash; 1 proposal<br />\r\nART-04-2016 &ndash; 4 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 &ndash; 6 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:30:29 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-07-2017(IA), ART-01-2017(IA), ART-03-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 22, 2016 3:52:48 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of first stage of 2016 two-stage topics <strong>(Flash Call Info)</strong> can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that the <strong>Generalised Feedback</strong> for the first stage of 2016 two-stage topics can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Previous updates:</strong></p>\r\n<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:36:56 PM", "content": "<p><u>On 20 January 2016 a total of 47 first-stage proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</u><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>ART-02-2016 - 2 proposals <br />\r\nART-04-2016 - 26 proposals <br />\r\nART-05-2016 - 19 proposals <br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:02:52 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ART-04-2016(RIA), ART-05-2016(RIA), ART-02-2016(IA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
