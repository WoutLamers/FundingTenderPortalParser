Working together, partners with complementary backgrounds, knowledge and skills, and in new and established value-chains, can turn these ideas into sustainable innovative products, processes and services that both address societal challenges and/or are highly competitive in global markets. FTI aims to accelerate this commercialisation process by providing extended funding opportunities through an open and agile scheme nurturing bottom-up ideas from innovative constituencies across Europe.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The FTI pilot supports projects undertaking innovation from the demonstration stage through to market uptake, including stages such as piloting, test-beds, systems validation in real world/working conditions, validation of business models, pre-normative research, and standard-setting. It targets relatively mature new technologies, concepts, processes and business models that need a last development step to reach the market and achieve wider deployment. To this end, if a proposal involves technological innovation, the consortium must declare that the technology or the technologies concerned are at least at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, where appropriate <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> . Projects can be interdisciplinary.</p><p>Proposals must relate to any field under the specific objective \"Leadership in enabling and industrial technologies\" and/or to any of the specific objectives under the priority \"Societal challenges\"<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>Proposals should specify the intended outcome of the project and describe its key performance indicators/success criteria.</p><p>Proposals must also include a business plan clearly describing the market potential (potential users/customers and benefits for them; targeted European/global markets, etc.), the business opportunities for participants, measures to enhance the probability of eventual commercial take-up and a credible commercialisation strategy that identifies next steps and specifies other actors to be involved. Particular attention should be paid to IP protection and ownership and to the possibility of commercial exploitation ('freedom to operate').</p><p>The expected impact should be clearly described in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Factors such as time sensitivity and the international competitive situation should be considered in the light of the technology/innovation fields and industry sectors concerned. Possible impacts on sustainability or climate change, in particular, or on other cross-cutting objectives of Horizon 2020<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, should also be highlighted.</p><p>Consortia must involve participation from industry. Universities, research and technology organisations and further innovation actors may also participate. Actors that can play a key role in the commercialisation process are encouraged to take part, such as cluster organisations, end-users, industrial associations, incubators, investors, or the public sector.
