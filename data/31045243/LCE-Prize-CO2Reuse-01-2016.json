Europe is working hard to cut its greenhouse gas emissions substantially while encouraging other nations and regions to do likewise. One way to help these efforts is to make use of the CO2 by integrating it in consumer products. CO2 re-use technologies however are still facing a number of technical, commercial and/or financial barriers.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This inducement prize will therefore reward innovative products utilising CO2 that could significantly reduce the atmospheric emissions of CO2 when deployed at commercial scale.</p><p>The prize will induce actors in the field of CO2 utilisation to do more to enhance their processes and products so that they reduce atmospheric emissions of CO2. It aims also to mobilise and enhance private R&amp;I investment, attract non-traditional players, create new partnerships and incentivise researchers and innovators to enhance efforts to abate emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to atmosphere.</p><p>The specific rules of the contest will be published in 2016 by the European Commission, which will directly launch and manage the contest and award the prize based on the judgement of independent experts.</p><p>Indicative prize amount: EUR 1.5 million.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The prize winner will be the entrant that has developed a product demonstrating, over the duration of the contest, the most significant and measurable improvements in the mass of CO2 utilised in it while overcoming technical, commercial and/or financial barriers. Efforts shall be replicable and scalable in order that the processes and products can be rolled out in the future. Clear commercialisation plans that are key to assuring medium-term benefits of the activities undertaken towards the prize will also have to be presented.</p><p>It is expected that the prize will accelerate innovation in CO2 utilisation technologies, also in SMEs; facilitate discovering the real potential of CO2 utilisation to contribute to climate mitigation; increase transparency about technology readiness, barriers, costs, environmental performance and innovation needs; increase leverage of private finance for innovation; provide with new business models and value chains in the CO2 utilisation sector.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception Footnote</SPAN>:<p>This activity directly aimed at supporting pilot activities is excluded from the delegation to INEA and will be implemented by the Commission services.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </strong></span>described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-co2-reuse_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">     </span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Eligibility and exclusion criteria:</span></strong> described in part 8 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-co2-reuse_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>.<br />\r\n    <em><br />\r\n    </em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to the application template.<em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Evaluation and award criteria and procedure:</span></strong> described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-co2-reuse_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>&nbsp;Indicative timetable for evaluation and award of prizes: </strong></span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">described in part 3 of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-co2-reuse_en.pdf\">Rules for Contest</a>.</span> <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><br />\r\n    </span></em></li>\r\n    <li>A<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>pplication templates and evaluation forms for prizes under this topic:</strong></span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Application template for inducement prizes&nbsp;is available after entering the submission tool below.<u><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_at/h2020-prizes-induc-at-co2-reuse_en.pdf\">Evaluation form for inducement prizes</a></u><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong>Additional provisions:</strong></span> described in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/prizes/contest_rules/h2020-prizes-induc-rules-co2-reuse_en.pdf\"><u>Rules for Contests</u></a>. <br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\"><strong><br />\r\n    The general rules for Prizes</strong></span> are described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-f-prizes_en.pdf\">part F of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Additional documents</span></strong>:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a>  <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-euratom-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Euratom Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme</a> <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash;

The EU is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 and by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Europe is working hard to cut its greenhouse gas emissions substantially while encouraging other nations and regions to do likewise. The EU has adopted a robust set of policies to promote renewable energy, energy efficiency and low carbon technologies such as carbon dioxide capture and storage. Carbon dioxide utilisation (CDU) technologies can also play a role in delivering Europe&rsquo;s climate change objectives, by using anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) as a feedstock in making industrial and consumer products, such as chemicals, building materials and substitute fuels. This can reduce emissions to the atmosphere, replace fossil-based feedstocks and products, and support renewable energy deployment through energy storage techniques. CDU technologies can also drive industrial innovation and contribute towards the circular economy by converting what was previously waste to useful material. More effort is needed to enhance and realise the potential of these technologies.<br />\r\nThe objective of this prize is to enhance the CO2 emission reduction of CO2 utilisation products so they make a genuine contribution to the European Union&rsquo;s emission reduction targets. </p>", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 5, 2016 7:12:41 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 5, 2016 7:12:41 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: LCE-Prize-CO2Reuse-01-2016(IPr)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
