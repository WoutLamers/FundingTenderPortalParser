The challenge for Europe is to capture the benefits from developing consumer-oriented platforms that require a strong cooperation between the telecom, hardware, software and service industries, to create and master innovative Internet Ecosystems. </p><p>This topic cuts across several LEIT-ICT challenges (smart systems integration, cyber-physical systems, smart networks, big data) and brings together different generic ICT technologies (nano-electronics, wireless networks, low-power computing, adaptive and cognitive systems) and their stakeholder constituencies. Their applicability across multiple application domains (e.g. ehealth, energy, food chain, intelligent transport and systems, environmental monitoring and logistics) bridges the gap to applications-specific developments under the H2020 Societal Challenges.</p><p><u>Scope</u>: The scope is to create ecosystems of \"Platforms for Connected Smart Objects\", integrating the future generations of devices, embedded systems and network technologies and other evolving ICT advances. These environments support citizen and businesses for a multiplicity of novel applications. They embed effective and efficient security and privacy mechanisms into devices, architectures, service and network platforms, including characteristics such as openness, dynamic expandability, interoperability, dependability, cognitive capabilities and distributed decision making, cost and energy-efficiency, ergonomic and user-friendliness. Such Smart Environments may be enriched through the deployment of wearable /ambulatory hardware to promote seamless environments</p><p>The Smart Environment(s) will provide a basis and methodology for developer's communities to test and validate in large-scale experiments low cost applications of e.g. wireless networks such as WSNs, M2M, and networked objects and spaces, as well as heterogeneous deployments and should be driven by use cases. </p><p><b>a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>Research & Innovation Actions</b>\u00a0 are focussed on the following: </p><p>Architectural concepts and concepts for semantic interoperability for \"Platforms for Connected Smart Objects\", which can cover multiple use cases whilst responding to specific requirements in terms of security, dependability, cognition and prioritised event processing. </p><p>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dynamically configured infrastructure and integration platforms for \"Connected Smart Objects\" covering multiple technologies and multiple intelligent artefacts, potentially including robots, and heterogeneous integration levels; dynamically configured information representation and interpretation leading to an extended Internet of Things.
