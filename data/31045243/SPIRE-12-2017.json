At the same time, regulatory bottlenecks to innovation in the process industry should be identified in order to ensure that innovative processes, technologies and products in the areas of circular economy, resource and energy efficiency can be introduced on the market in a faster timeframe.</p><p>In addition, many production plants, companies and industrial parks are presently using their own protocols and standards, which in many cases do not match those used by other similar companies. This means that it can be difficult to perform cross-sectorial technology transfer and thereby achieve efficiency improvements.</p><p>Before any changes in policies are considered, a very careful and well-thought analysis should be undertaken in order to minimise the risk of potential negative impact on innovation and on the uptake of technology.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>A clear, consistent and predictable regulatory framework is needed, as well as a set of standards. Proposed support actions should cover the needs of the different industrial sectors representing big and small companies within the process industry. Their objective should be to identify and to propose solutions along the value chain, required to reach long term sustainability for Europe in terms of global competitiveness, ecology and employment.</p><p>The evaluation of current policies and regulatory or standardisation needs could include recommendations within the following areas: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Re-use of different grades of wastewater for industrial purposes. </li>  <li>Re-use of different types of waste (e.g. through re-classification) as feed for industrial production and/or energy sources. </li>  <li>Recovery of valuable materials, metals and minerals from waste. </li>  <li>Lifecycle Assessment methodologies to allow a harmonised comparison between industries and sectors. </li>  <li>Production of advanced renewable fuels from the use of CO<sub>2</sub> as feedstock. </li>  <li>General harmonisation of the European Waste, Water and Energy policies. </li>  <li>Eliminating bottlenecks for the transferability of new technologies across European borders. </li>  <li>Eliminating bottlenecks that prevent the stimulation of investments in new technologies, e.g. within clean and low carbon technologies. </li>  <li>New standardisation methodologies that facilitate continuous production.</li> </ul><p>While in some cases it is necessary to recommend harmonisation on a European scale through regulation and European standards, in other cases it may only be necessary to enable transferability of technology across sectorial boundaries.</p><p>Examples for this could be (but are not restricted to) the following: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>IT control systems and plant monitoring systems facilitating industrial symbiosis. </li>  <li>Equipment for Process Intensification. </li>  <li>Equipment for small scale localised production.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 500000 and 1000000 would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

This focus area will bring together complementary activities, which as a whole will address the overall objectives of enhancing European industrial competitiveness and moving towards a circular economy.<br />\r\nActions will support the goals outlined in the Communications &lsquo;Towards a circular economy: A zero waste programme for Europe&rsquo; and &lsquo;European Industrial Renaissance&rsquo;, and are in line with the Commission's new Roadmap for a Circular Economy Strategy. They follow up the European Council conclusions of March and June 2014, in particular the Council's call for a systemic approach to cleantech.<br />\r\nThere are synergies to be reaped from working across different pillars of Horizon 2020 in tapping new sources of green growth and maximising the uptake of new opportunities by industry, including SMEs. These are expected to boost investment and job creation, and consolidate Europe's global green leadership.<br />\r\nThis call supports systemic innovation, which is understood as innovation that aims at responding to a societal challenge by obtaining a systems-wide transformation through affecting the system's economic, social and environmental dimensions. This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nThe industrial side of this call is based on the contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs) on Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industries (SPIRE), with a strong element on industrial pilot lines for nanotechnology and advanced materials. It will help develop and deploy the necessary key enabling technologies to support EU manufacturing across a broad range of sectors. It will help European industry to meet the increasing global consumer demand for greener, more customised and higher quality products through the necessary transition to a demand-driven industry with less waste and a better use of resources.<br />\r\nTo underpin the systemic approach, circular economy models play an important role as they boost innovation and involve all stakeholders in value chain(s) increasing resource efficiency. The circular economy is an economy in which production and consumption are organised in a way that the value of products, components, materials and resources is maintained or enhanced throughout the value chain and the life of the products. The circular economy decouples the creation of wealth and jobs from the consumption of resources (e.g. energy, water and primary raw materials), maximises resource productivity and minimises resource extraction and waste.<br />\r\nSpecific objectives of the actions in this call include a reduction of costs and emissions, a more efficient use of energy and resources, and a cascade use of materials. Pioneering new production and consumption patterns and related technological and non-technological solutions will strengthen EU&rsquo;s position and that of its industry in new markets. Systemic solutions need to be examined, developed and demonstrated throughout value chains, while addressing all influencing factors: policy and framework conditions that affect business and finance models; industrial manufacturing and processing; eco-design of products including design for repair, disassembly and durability, energy efficiency; reduction of GHG emissions; new and efficient use of primary and secondary raw materials; green and innovative public procurement (GPP); management, governance, social innovation; and new forms of consumer behaviour.
