While common technological and market solutions to link energy systems across Europe are the subject of topics LCE 1-5 of this Work Programme, the implementation of new technological options and business processes is needed to optimise systems on a local (e.g. municipalities) and regional level (in the sense of regions within a country) and to link them to a secure and resilient European energy system.</p><p>Local and regional utilities, SMEs and start-up companies could play a major role to provide the technological, economic, legal and organisational knowledge and build co-creation ecosystems with private and communal initiatives to develop and implement respective solutions. The acceptance of these new energy solutions could allow for consumers and citizens to participate in sharing models and smart business processes and be actors in the local energy system.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area.</p><p>Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding.</p><p>The scope of activities should range from \u201ctechnical energy grids\u201d to \u201cbusiness and citizen networks for energy\u201d relying on tools that have been developed in practical exercises throughout Europe in regions, municipalities, small utilities and innovative SMEs. This implies to bridge various energy domains (e. g. power, heat) to make best use of local and regional potentials.</p><p>The proposed actions should close the gap between technical availability and deployment. A key challenge for the proposed actions will be to integrate the market uptake mechanism that have been studied for every single energy carrier and generation technology and deploy them exploiting regional characteristics, networking structures and drivers. Proposals should build include the set-up of a knowledge platforms (such as developed for example by ERA-Net Smart Grid Plus) and promote transnational mutual learning. Proposals should deal with innovative technologies such as IT platforms, storage that links multiple energy carriers, etc. and latest trends such as sharing economy, to develop innovative services, governance models and business structures that allow for involving consumers and citizens as true market partners.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution in the range of EUR 7.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Projects funded under this topic will therefore by default provide open access to the research data they generate, except if they decide to opt-out under the conditions described in annex L of the Work Programme. Projects can opt-out at any stage, that is both before and after the grant signature.</p>\r\n    <p>Note that the evaluation phase proposals will not be evaluated more favourably because they plan to open or share their data, and will not be penalised for opting out.</p>\r\n    <p>Open research data sharing applies to the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications. Additionally, projects can choose to make other data available open access and need to describe their approach in a Data Management Plan.</p>\r\n    <p>- Projects need to create a Data Management Plan (DMP), except if they opt-out of making their research data open access. A first version of the DMP must be provided as an early deliverable within six months of the project and should be updated during the project as appropriate. The Commission already provides guidance documents, including a template for DMPs.</p>\r\n    <p>- Eligibility of costs: costs related to data management and data sharing are eligible for reimbursement during the project duration.</p>\r\n    <p>The legal requirements for projects participating in this pilot are in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf#page=66\">article 29.3 of the Model Grant Agreement.<br />\r\n    </a><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Additional documents:</span></strong><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-intro_en.pdf\"><br />\r\n    H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Introduction</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-energy_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Secure, clean and efficient energy</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-transport_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Smart, green and integrated transport</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ttp://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-comm-diss_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Dissemination, Exploitation and Evaluation</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-ga_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: General Annexes</a><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-eu-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a>  <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/fp/h2020-euratom-establact_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Euratom Horizon 2020 - Regulation of Establishment</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/rules_participation/h2020-rules-participation_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Rules for Participation</a> <br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/legal_basis/sp/h2020-sp_en.pdf\">Legal basis: Horizon 2020 Specific Programme</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/index_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a></strong> your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash; Submission of proposals.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal4/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html\">National Contact Points (NCP)</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></strong><span>contact your NCP for further assistance.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?lg=en&amp;pg=enquiries\">Research Enquiry Service</a></span></strong><span> &ndash; ask questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular.</span><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://een.ec.europa.eu/\"><br />\r\n<strong>Enterprise Europe Network</strong></a> &ndash; contact your EEN national contact for advice to businesses with special focus on SMEs.
