Precision agriculture, mapping and surveying have been the pioneers in the use of GNSS since the early years. The challenge is to make these applications more affordable, easy to use and integrated with other solutions and technologies, including for example earth observation, e.g. Copernicus services, in order to enable new targeted innovative solutions. EGNSS is offering additional accuracy and features, such as multiple frequencies and the high precision service in the frame of the future commercial service, contributing to enabling these innovative solutions, including in challenging environments. Power networks, telecommunication networks and financial transactions<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> are today synchronised, many of them using GNSS. These networks are becoming more and more distributed (e.g. distributed power generation of renewable energies), interconnected and more demanding in terms of synchronisation performances (e.g. in 4G-LTE and future internet), or requiring authenticated solutions as for the financial transaction time stamping. The specific challenge is in this case to build on the enhanced capabilities offered by Galileo that will provide high accurate timing information and authentication services, to develop a new generation of high performing, reliable and EU independent timing and synchronisation applications that can cope with these emerging and demanding needs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, building also on the combination of EGNSS with earth observation and Copernicus services, with commercial impact or with satellite communication. Proposals should have a clear market uptake perspective. Below are some areas which are identified as especially promising for further EGNSS application development:</p><p><strong>Agriculture: </strong>Automated machine guidance, precision farming and machine control and field boundary measurements are possible areas to be addressed.</p><p><strong>Surveying and Mapping: </strong>Land survey, marine survey, cadastral and geodesy, and construction are possible areas to be addressed.</p><p><strong>Timing and Synchronisation: </strong>Telecommunications, power generation and finance are possible areas to be addressed.</p><p><strong>Other professional applications:</strong> clearly demonstrating amongst others the contribution of EGNSS differentiators, the potential of integration with earth observation data, and the future commercial potential are also invited.</p><p>For all the professional areas, the development and innovation should build on:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Multiple-frequencies E1, E5 and E6;</li>  <li>Galileo specific signal modulation, e.g. AltBOC;</li>  <li>High precision and authentication services that will be provided by Galileo, i.e. in the frame of the commercial service;</li>  <li>Fusion with other data, such as from earth observation satellites or other in-situ sensors.</li> </ul><p>EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p><p>The proposal shall have a clear intention to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan.</p><p>Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Activities should aim at developing highly innovative applications taking advantage of Galileo and EGNOS aiming at decreasing the barriers to access such professional applications, in term of price of the solution and easiness to use, increasing the number of users and explore new innovative use of GNSS. Specifically for agriculture the expected impact is also to improve the productivity and decrease the environmental impact. For timing and synchronisation applications, the expected impact is to contribute to cope with emerging network synchronisation needs in terms of accuracy and robustness, while contributing to improve EU dependency from other GNSS.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Cf. also Article 50 of Directive 2014/65/EU on Markets in Financial Instruments.</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_australia_en.pdf\">Australia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_brazil_en.pdf\">Brazil</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_canada_en.pdf\">Canada</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_hong_kong_en.pdf\">Hong Kong &amp;Macau</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_india_en.pdf\">India</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>).&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.

The Galileo system will provide position, navigation and timing services and increase availability and reliability of other GNSS, while ensuring the European non-dependence from other GNSS. The EGNOS system improves the accuracy and provides information on the reliability of the GPS system, and in the future also of the Galileo system.</p><p>Satellite navigation technology is an increasingly common component of innovative applications in different market segment. Over the years satellite navigation has become more affordable and more reliable. GNSS is used all around the globe, with 2.8 billion GNSS devices in use in 2013. By 2019, this is forecasted to increase to over 7 billion \u2013 on average one device per person. This large base of satellite navigation powered devices opens a huge opportunity for innovation in terms of applications in transport, consumer and professional markets. In addition, the new generation of GNSS, such as Galileo, brings new specific features and increased performance that can trigger innovation and enable more accurate and robust applications.</p><p>Development of downstream applications is key to maximise adoption of Galileo and EGNOS and also to stimulate the EU GNSS downstream industry competitiveness, while capturing public benefits. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are key players for innovation in the sector of GNSS applications for their capacity of innovating quickly, adapting to this fast growing and changing domain. While EGNOS is already fully operational, Galileo is still in deployment phase and will gradually start to deliver services from 2016 onwards up to a full capability in 2020. The use of the available Galileo initial services and test beds[[List of Galileo test infrastructure is available: http://gnss-test-portal.eu/tools/list_all_in_category/3]] in the course of the proposed projects is encouraged if and when necessary and beneficial for the project.</p><p>GNSS technology is advancing fast. Current trends that will influence innovation in the field of GNSS applications should be taken into account by applicants. These trends concern for example the appearance of a multi-constellation environment, leading to new multi-frequency devices that are becoming accessible also for mass market applications, as well as the increased combination of GNSS with other sensors and positioning techniques (e.g. Bluetooth beacons, localisation through Wi-Fi base stations, etc.). GNSS receivers itself are undergoing miniaturisation and are more and more \"always connected\".</p><p>To facilitate access to opportunities for applicants the following list includes dedicated 'Applications in Satellite Navigation \u2013 Galileo' activities in related calls and topics from the societal challenge Smart, Green and Integrated Transport, in addition to those in this call: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Societal Challenge Smart Green and Integrated Transport:   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>Automated Road Transport:     <ul level=\"2\">      <li>ART-02-2016: Automation pilots for passenger vehicles </li>     </ul> </li>    <li>Mobility for Growth:     <ul level=\"2\">      <li>MG-5.2-2017: Innovative ICT solutions for future logistics operations </li>     </ul> </li>   </ul> </li>  <li>SME Instrument (H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017), although not dedicated uniquely to Satellite Navigation, is particularly well suited for SMEs addressing space based applications:   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>SMEInst-04-2016-2017: Engaging SMEs in space research and development </li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Applications in Satellite Navigation (H2020-GALILEO-GSA-2017)   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>Galileo 1 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Transport Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 2 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Mass Market Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 3 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Professional Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 4 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Awareness raising and capacity buildings </li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>In accordance with the Commission decision C(2014)4995 this call will be implemented by the European GNSS Agency in indirect management.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 20, 2017 4:16:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 20, 2017 4:16:56 PM", "content": "<p>The evaluation results for H2020-Galileo-GSA-2017 (flash call info) are now available under the &quot;Additional Documents&quot; section of each topic</p>\r\n<p>A total of <strong>79 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is as follows:<br />\r\nGALILEO-1-2017\t<strong>35</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-2-2017\t<strong>13</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-3-2017\t<strong>23</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-4-2017\t<strong>8</strong></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 7, 2017 3:46:39 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 7, 2017 3:46:39 PM", "content": "<p>A total of <strong>79 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is as follows:<br />\r\nGALILEO-1-2017\t<strong>35</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-2-2017\t<strong>13</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-3-2017\t<strong>23</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-4-2017\t<strong>8</strong></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:08 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:08 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GALILEO-4-2017(CSA), GALILEO-3-2017(IA), GALILEO-2-2017(IA), GALILEO-1-2017(IA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
