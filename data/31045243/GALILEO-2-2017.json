Nowadays this also includes tablets, laptops, cameras, fitness gears and wearable devices, etc. In addition, recent trends are showing that not only \u201cevery person\u201d but in the future also \u201ceverything\u201d will be connected and equipped with a GNSS device (e.g. connected vehicles and internet of things). This is opening a new generation of Location Based Services (LBS). The development of this new generation of LBS is driven by different needs, depending on the application: mobility, productivity, safety, etc. To satisfy these needs, the key requirements for GNSS are Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF), accuracy and availability. Galileo satellites will further improve signal availability, thus enhancing continuity of service for LBS in urban or challenging environments. By contributing to multi-constellation solutions, Galileo can satisfy the need for higher accuracy and fast TTFF of demanding applications. </p><p>The specific challenge of this topic is to exploit the availability of GNSS enabled mass market devices, developing innovative EGNSS applications that will:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Foster the adoption of EGNOS and Galileo in mass markets and ensure that the benefits will be captured by the users.</li>  <li>Create applications that will make best use of EGNSS innovative features such as better multipath resistance, authentication etc.</li>  <li>Contribute to the competitiveness of the European GNSS industry in the area of mobile applications, with special focus on the innovative role of SMEs.</li>  <li>Maximise public benefits by supporting the development of applications that will address major societal challenges in focus areas such as health, citizen safety, mobility, smart cities, sustainable resources monitoring and management, regional growth, low-carbon energy infrastructure planning and protection, climate action.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should aim at developing new innovative applications, with commercial impact and a clear market uptake perspective. Below are some areas which are identified as especially promising for further EGNSS applications development:</p><p><strong>Mobility as a service and Smart Cities: </strong>Development of EGNSS solutions for cross-modal mobility and new emerging \u201cmobility as a service\u201d approach should be addressed, in which the user does not buy a vehicle or a public transport ticket, but a service to comply with her/his mobility needs. This area may include innovative telematics applications in which the positioning, timing and navigation are used both to deliver the mobility service and to calculate a fair price based on the actual use of it. Development of EGNSS solutions for other areas of future Smart Cities are also included in the scope.</p><p><strong>Internet of things: </strong>Development of EGNSS solutions for \u201cinternet of things\u201d should be addressed, exploiting the interconnectivity of uniquely identifiable devices and the availability of their location. Proposals should duly reflect the fact that the internet of things is not only improving productivity and efficiency of organisations (with applications in almost every sector of the economy, from automotive to consumer electronics, healthcare or manufacturing and logistics), but that the internet of things technology is also changing our daily lives.</p><p><strong>Commercial and social LBS: </strong>Proposals should address one of the two following application areas. 1) Applications for commercial LBS, such as: secure financial transactions; mobile workforce management, tracking solutions; augmented reality; social networking and sport. 2) Applications for social LBS, such as: safety and emergency (E112), e-health (health services more and more connected), and solutions supporting visual and mobility of impaired people.</p><p>For all the mass market areas, the development and innovation should build on:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Galileo features that improve performances in urban environment ;</li>  <li>Multi-constellation, fusion with other positioning techniques, including sensor fusion and innovative network fusion techniques;</li>  <li>Authentication services that will be provided by Galileo; and</li>  <li>Techniques to optimise power consumption.</li> </ul><p>Attention should be paid to socio-economic considerations such as consumer needs, consumer behaviour (including early adopters), lifestyles, as well due consideration should be given to applicable legal frameworks and ethical issues such as privacy and data protection.</p><p>EGNSS should be part and parcel of the envisaged solution(s). However, where a combination of EGNSS with other technologies is required to make the application(s) work, this is not excluded from the scope.</p><p>In projects to be funded under this topic participation of industry, in particular SMEs, is encouraged.</p><p>Proposals addressing PRS (Public Regulated Service) related applications are not in the scope of this action.</p><p>The Commission considers that one proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Activities should aim at developing highly innovative and adaptive applications taking advantage of the Galileo and EGNOS added value. The proposal shall have a clear intention to commercialise the products and services developed, including a business plan. The consumer chipset and devices manufacturers (e.g. for smartphones and tablets) are mainly produced in non-European countries and the expected impact of this topic is to foster the competitiveness of European GNSS application providers that build innovation on these chipsets and devices, contributing to increase the overall EU competitiveness in the mass market. In addition, considering that the EU has a good market share of machine to machine chipset and module providers, the expected impact is also to foster applications building on this capacity.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_australia_en.pdf\">Australia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_brazil_en.pdf\">Brazil</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_canada_en.pdf\">Canada</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_hong_kong_en.pdf\">Hong Kong &amp;Macau</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_india_en.pdf\">India</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>).&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.

The Galileo system will provide position, navigation and timing services and increase availability and reliability of other GNSS, while ensuring the European non-dependence from other GNSS. The EGNOS system improves the accuracy and provides information on the reliability of the GPS system, and in the future also of the Galileo system.</p><p>Satellite navigation technology is an increasingly common component of innovative applications in different market segment. Over the years satellite navigation has become more affordable and more reliable. GNSS is used all around the globe, with 2.8 billion GNSS devices in use in 2013. By 2019, this is forecasted to increase to over 7 billion \u2013 on average one device per person. This large base of satellite navigation powered devices opens a huge opportunity for innovation in terms of applications in transport, consumer and professional markets. In addition, the new generation of GNSS, such as Galileo, brings new specific features and increased performance that can trigger innovation and enable more accurate and robust applications.</p><p>Development of downstream applications is key to maximise adoption of Galileo and EGNOS and also to stimulate the EU GNSS downstream industry competitiveness, while capturing public benefits. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are key players for innovation in the sector of GNSS applications for their capacity of innovating quickly, adapting to this fast growing and changing domain. While EGNOS is already fully operational, Galileo is still in deployment phase and will gradually start to deliver services from 2016 onwards up to a full capability in 2020. The use of the available Galileo initial services and test beds[[List of Galileo test infrastructure is available: http://gnss-test-portal.eu/tools/list_all_in_category/3]] in the course of the proposed projects is encouraged if and when necessary and beneficial for the project.</p><p>GNSS technology is advancing fast. Current trends that will influence innovation in the field of GNSS applications should be taken into account by applicants. These trends concern for example the appearance of a multi-constellation environment, leading to new multi-frequency devices that are becoming accessible also for mass market applications, as well as the increased combination of GNSS with other sensors and positioning techniques (e.g. Bluetooth beacons, localisation through Wi-Fi base stations, etc.). GNSS receivers itself are undergoing miniaturisation and are more and more \"always connected\".</p><p>To facilitate access to opportunities for applicants the following list includes dedicated 'Applications in Satellite Navigation \u2013 Galileo' activities in related calls and topics from the societal challenge Smart, Green and Integrated Transport, in addition to those in this call: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Societal Challenge Smart Green and Integrated Transport:   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>Automated Road Transport:     <ul level=\"2\">      <li>ART-02-2016: Automation pilots for passenger vehicles </li>     </ul> </li>    <li>Mobility for Growth:     <ul level=\"2\">      <li>MG-5.2-2017: Innovative ICT solutions for future logistics operations </li>     </ul> </li>   </ul> </li>  <li>SME Instrument (H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017), although not dedicated uniquely to Satellite Navigation, is particularly well suited for SMEs addressing space based applications:   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>SMEInst-04-2016-2017: Engaging SMEs in space research and development </li>   </ul> </li>  <li>Applications in Satellite Navigation (H2020-GALILEO-GSA-2017)   <ul level=\"1\">    <li>Galileo 1 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Transport Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 2 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Mass Market Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 3 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Professional Applications;</li>    <li>Galileo 4 \u2013 2017 \u2013 EGNSS Awareness raising and capacity buildings </li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>In accordance with the Commission decision C(2014)4995 this call will be implemented by the European GNSS Agency in indirect management.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 20, 2017 4:16:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 20, 2017 4:16:56 PM", "content": "<p>The evaluation results for H2020-Galileo-GSA-2017 (flash call info) are now available under the &quot;Additional Documents&quot; section of each topic</p>\r\n<p>A total of <strong>79 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is as follows:<br />\r\nGALILEO-1-2017\t<strong>35</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-2-2017\t<strong>13</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-3-2017\t<strong>23</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-4-2017\t<strong>8</strong></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 7, 2017 3:46:39 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 7, 2017 3:46:39 PM", "content": "<p>A total of <strong>79 proposals </strong>were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>The number of proposals for each topic is as follows:<br />\r\nGALILEO-1-2017\t<strong>35</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-2-2017\t<strong>13</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-3-2017\t<strong>23</strong><br />\r\nGALILEO-4-2017\t<strong>8</strong></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:08 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:08 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GALILEO-4-2017(CSA), GALILEO-3-2017(IA), GALILEO-2-2017(IA), GALILEO-1-2017(IA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
