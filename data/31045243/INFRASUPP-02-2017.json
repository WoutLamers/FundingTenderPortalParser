Following the communication of the Commission on International Cooperation in Research and Innovation (COM(2012)497), international cooperation for research infrastructures is needed with a number of key third countries/regions seen as strategic for the development, exploitation and management of world-class research infrastructures necessary to address research challenges with a global dimension.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals will address only one of the following areas:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Develop a model describing the socio-economic impact of Research Infrastructures and of their related financial investments. The model should be adaptable to a broad range of scientific domains and types of infrastructures. It should contribute to a common approach at international level and facilitate investments in Research Infrastructures by funding agencies and other stakeholders. Proposals will take stock of the different existing models for research infrastructures and integrate, as appropriate, their findings in one single model. The activity should take into account the work of the Research Infrastructure Socio-Economic Impact Working group, being established by the OECD Global Science Forum, and involve major key international players in this domain.</li>  <li>European support to the Research Data Alliance, RDA: Proposals are expected to support the development of global interoperable research data infrastructures that will greatly benefit the coordination at European level addressing all the points below. The objective is (a) support to the RDA secretariat for logistics, open access to RDA reference documents and dissemination activities (b) support the emergence of building blocks of an open, interoperable data infrastructure fostering interoperability across regions, organisations and scientific disciplines (c) support ESFRI infrastructures and new communities to engage in Open Science and data sharing principles. In particular, the proposal activities should provide financial support of the organisation and coordination of European stakeholders' active participation and contribution to the Research Data Alliance<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</li> </ol><p><em>At least a proposal per area will be selected. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million for the first area and between EUR 3 and 3.5 million for the second area (RDA) would allow this topic to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>This activity will help to:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Develop cooperation with key international partners for research infrastructures;</li>  <li>Enhance the role of the Union in international organisations and multilateral fora.</li> </ul><p>For the first area (model for socio-economic impact) further expected impact of the action is the enhancement of partnerships between policy makers, funding bodies, academia and industry and the promotion of the development of appropriate tools in support of decision making.</p><p>For the second area (European support to RDA) further expected impact of the action is the following: Europe will be in a leading position in enabling the use of the world's store of research data in multi-disciplinary, data intensive global scientific collaborations. It will help the development and adoption of relevant international open standards based on the best practices of a large spectrum of research communities. It will engage research communities at early stages of standards development and address common data requirements for new services bringing together users and technology providers. It will promote sustainable models for research data sharing and install trust in the adopted solutions.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=OpenScience;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Open Science</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>COM (2012) 392 final</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>In line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">1.
