World leaders have started producing batteries and cells of the lithium-ion family since the nineties for mass consumer electronics such as personal computers and mobile phones, giving them the opportunity to acquire experience in mass production, optimize their technologies and create product diversification. Europe is strong in providing the raw electrochemical materials and the production equipment, however experience and knowledge on production at mass scale is missing. Small scale production of lithium cells is taking place for niche applications, but lack of mass markets such as consumer electronics makes mass production for automotive applications unlikely due to high entry barriers but also to less performing electrochemical formulations.</p><p>To develop its production base, Europe should develop more competitive chemistries and start-up-scaling production lines and progressively acquire the necessary knowledge and experience to further optimise battery technology.</p><p>At the same time, Li-ion technology is evolving rapidly. Several lithium cell variants exist (Lithium Nickel Cobalt Manganese, Lithium Nickel Cobalt Aluminium, Lithium Iron Phosphate, etc.) or are under intensive investigation (e. g. Lithium Sulphur, Lithium Silicon, Lithium Polymer and also a combination of several variants). For the time being none of the variants under investigation that would have a significant impact on batteries energy density (and electric vehicles range) and cost is clearly emerging as the most promising one. In addition, none of these variants reached sufficient maturity to envisage any large scale industrial exploitation. Significant investment in R&amp;D in this area is still required.</p><p>Developing mass production of cells based on today's conventional Li-ion technologies would not give Europe an advantage to compete with world leaders in the field because Europe would lag behind in chemistries and manufacturing processes. Asian manufacturers benefit from high economies of scale because of existing mass production infrastructure and thus have the possibilities to commercially hinder new competitors from entering the market. However, Europe is strong in packaging and electronics for batteries.</p><p>It is now time to integrate battery cell production technologies into research activities. This initiative is intended to coordinate running national initiatives and prepare for stronger European research and innovation activities to be launched in the coming years. Such activities would support the objectives of the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda within the Energy Union policy.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The scope of the topic covers production processes for future variants of lithium cells such as advanced lithium-ion not excluding the so-called post-lithium-ion technologies. Developing manufacturing processes specific to a given technology that has not yet reached the necessary level of maturity would be premature and risky. Therefore the topic focusses on the two following areas which could be applied to broader transport modes and even for stationary energy storage applications:</p><p>\u2015To evaluate the most promising next generation of Li-ion or post-Li-ion-systems (in comparison with the best-in-class Li-ion-System) that could reach the market in the very near future and clearly identify potential challenges in the manufacturing process that would give Europe a competitive advantage when mastering the most promising improved Li-ion or post-Li-ion chemistry. The project partnership should form a forum of the different players: transport vehicles and vessels manufacturers, Tier 1 suppliers, equipment suppliers and research institutes.</p><p>\u2015Develop new production technologies within the different manufacturing stages provided that they are generic enough to show reduced dependency on a specific chemistry to support industrial partners in the area of manufacturing and to increase the knowledge base of production technologies.</p><p>Examples of generic technologies might be:</p><p>\u2015Battery technologies with Li-anode, bipolar batteries, all-solid-state battery technologies (e.g. ceramics, polymers, post graphite technologies \u2026)</p><p>\u2015Electrode coating independent of solvents or solvent free</p><p>\u2015New processing techniques (mixing, milling of powders, new dyeing techniques, DryCoating, etc.)</p><p>\u2015Technologies that allow integration of in-situ quality monitoring</p><p>\u2015Methods of ultrafast handling and monitoring of electrodes (e.g. assessment of electrode quality to minimize scrap)</p><p>\u2015Data processing, standardised interfaces according to industry 4.0</p><p>\u2015Flexible assembly lines that can accommodate to different cell formats.</p><p>\u2015Improvement of coating width and speed, double sided simultaneous coating (of electrode sheets)</p><p>\u2015Coatings not needing clean rooms</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 3 and 5 million each would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>\u2015To allow Europe to recover competitiveness without targeting a specific technology in the production of future battery cells for transport and energy applications</p><p>\u2015Increase production related knowledge and develop technologies for modular battery cell production lines in order to improve quality and decrease cost of battery cells that are ready to be deployed</p><p>\u2015Contribute to sustainable production by either reducing scrap directly or recycling measures</p><p>\u2015The results of the research could also benefit battery cell manufacture in Europe for other sectors such as stationary storage and storage for long-distance transport</p><p>\u2015The battery concepts should improve energy, power and safety in comparison to current technical standard.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: #003366\"><strong>List of countries and applicable rules for funding</strong>: </span>described in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

It includes research, technological developments, innovation and demonstration in support of improvements in energy efficiency of road transport vehicles and the use of new types of non-conventional energies in road transport such as electricity, CNG and LNG, renewable and tailored fuels. In addition to improving road transport performance with respect to CO2 and other climate-change relevant emissions, EGVI is also aimed at achieving a positive impact on health issues due to polluting and noise emissions, particularly in urban environments.</p><p>The scope of the EGVI activities include both advanced power-train technologies and new vehicle architectures, weight reduction, improved aerodynamics and rolling resistance and component development for alternative fuel vehicles. Concerning new forms of energy, the interfaces between the vehicles and the recharging infrastructure will also need to be taken into account with particular attention to standardisation issues. Demonstration activities will play an essential role in ensuring a proper and timely deployment of the new technologies.</p><p>This call has been defined taking into account the other calls and initiatives where the Transport Challenge is concerned, particularly the calls on \u2018Mobility for Growth\u2019 and \u2018Smart Cities and Communities\u2019, and the \u2018Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2\u2019 joint undertakings. Multi-sectorial research involving other research and innovation areas such as Energy and Environment coupled with research on new materials, advanced production and Information and Communication Technologies will be encouraged, particularly in fields such as advanced energy storage systems and interfaces between vehicles and energy recharging infrastructures.</p><p>In addition to the topics of this call, a topic on materials allowing affordable weight reduction of high-volume vehicles and its components, taking into account the entire life-cycle (NMBP 08\u20132016), is included in \u201cNanotechnologies, Advanced materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing\u201d under \u201cLeadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies\u201d (LEIT).</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "May 16, 2017 4:17:40 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 16, 2017 4:17:40 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on the results of&nbsp;call H2020-GV-2017&nbsp;(Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "May 16, 2017 4:09:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 16, 2017 4:09:03 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of&nbsp;call H2020-GV-2017&nbsp;(Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 14, 2017 3:07:59 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 14, 2017 3:07:59 PM", "content": "<p>On 1 February 2017 a total of 58 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>GV-01-2017 &ndash; 4 proposals<br />\r\nGV-04-2017 &ndash; 14 proposals <br />\r\nGV-05-2017 &ndash; 4 proposals<br />\r\nGV-06-2017 &ndash; 5 proposals<br />\r\nGV-07-2017 &ndash; 8 proposals<br />\r\nGV-08-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\nGV-09-2017 &ndash; 2 proposals<br />\r\nGV-10-2017 &ndash; 10 proposals<br />\r\nGV-13-2017 &ndash; 8 proposals</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 4, 2016 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 4, 2016 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GV-08-2017(IA), GV-13-2017(RIA), GV-06-2017(IA), GV-04-2017(RIA), GV-05-2017(RIA), GV-07-2017(RIA), GV-01-2017(IA), GV-10-2017(IA), GV-09-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:39:40 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:39:40 PM", "content": "<p>On 26 January 2016 a total of 21 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</p>\r\n<p>GV-02-2016 - 14 proposals <br />\r\nGV-03-2016 - 7 proposals </p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:05:40 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:05:40 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GV-11-2016(CSA), GV-12-2016(ERA-NET-Cofund)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
