An improved insulation in buildings will have a large impact on the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions at European level. It can also bring significant environmental, economic and social benefits both for the Member States and for the citizens.</p><p>Although currently many materials are available on the market, there is a strong need to develop affordable advanced insulation materials which exceed the performance of presently used materials, and also respect strict sustainability principles.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should address the development and characterisation of new insulation materials and solutions based on nanotechnologies and/or advanced sustainable materials and offering enhanced insulation properties and environmental performance. Proposals could also consider highly effective insulation materials that respond dynamically to environmental stimuli (temperature, light, humidity, air and biological pollution, etc..)</p><p>The proposed solutions should go well beyond the state of the art and take into account the final performance properties of the new materials and of the respective building components.</p><p>The following factors should also be considered: enhanced durability for increased use duration, reduced maintenance and reduced costs; respect of sustainability principles (the sustainability of each developed solution should be evaluated via life cycle assessment studies carried out according to the International Reference Life Cycle Data System - ILCD Handbook); reduced embodied energy and minimised environmental impacts; applicability to both new build and renovation; lightweight construction and ease of installation; realistic solutions at a competitive price; limited impact on living space; improvement of indoor air quality; increased comfort and noise reduction; fully compatible with a wide set of material combinations which reflect the wide variety of building typologies across the EU; fit for deconstruction; reuse/recycling of materials at end of life. Resistance to damaging agents such as fire, moisture, rodents etc. should also be considered when relevant for the application. Standardisation aspects should be included particularly in relation with the work carried out in CEN/TC 350. Additional properties such as multi-functionality, load bearing capacity (and other mechanical properties), and use of wastes may also be considered.</p><p>Proof of concept in terms of one (or more) component(s) containing the new materials developed should be delivered within the project, excluding commercially usable prototypes (2006/C323/01), but convincingly demonstrating scalability towards industrial needs duly justifying availability of the proposed materials for potential further massive use and wide replication across Europe. Information guides for applications, installation and training on the new solutions should be provided before the end of the project.</p><p>In addition to the industrial, academic and construction stakeholders, the participation of public authorities would also be an asset for the proposals, as public authorities own a large part of the building stock at European level.</p><p><strong>Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL 6. </strong></p><p><em>This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.</em></p><p>The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Compared to state of the art materials and components, the newly developed materials should bring:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Improvement by at least 25% of the insulation properties at component level; </li>  <li>Reduction by at least 20% of the total costs compared to existing solutions; </li>  <li>Improvement by at least 20 % of durability at component level; </li>  <li>Respect of sustainability principles;</li>  <li>Improvement in indoor air quality; </li>  <li>Proof of high replication potential both in new built and renovation in Europe; </li>  <li>Easier implementation; </li>  <li>At least a 15% reduction of the energy spent during the whole life cycle of a building; </li>  <li>Contribution to standardisation and certification activities.</li> </ul><p><em>Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme</em>.</p><p>To maximise their impact, the funded projects are expected to cluster with each other in order to facilitate research cohesion, integration, and advancement of the EeB-PPP agenda.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs)</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=cPPP;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EeB</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><strong>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>LIST&nbsp;OF&nbsp;COUNTRIES and APPLICABLE&nbsp;RULES&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;FUNDING: </strong></span><br />\r\n    described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects <br />\r\n    (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>ELIGIBILITY and ADMISSIBILITY CONDITIONS:</strong> </span><br />\r\n    described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Proposal page limits and layout:</strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>EVALUATION </strong></span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>3.1&nbsp;

Yet, together with the 2050 deadlines, such Directives are putting more constraints on a sector which is directly impacted by the on-going financial and economic crisis, taking into account that, although Europe has major companies, <strong>this sector is highly fragmented with over 95% of SMEs</strong>.</p><p>The objective of the <em>Energy-efficient Buildings</em> Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Initiative is to drive the creation of a high-tech building industry which turns energy efficiency into a sustainable business, fostering EU competitiveness in the construction sector on a global level.</p><p>This call will complement the call on Energy Efficiency of the Energy societal challenge, by helping deliver, implement and optimise building and district concepts that have the technical, economic and societal potential to drastically reduce energy consumption and decrease CO2 emissions, both in relation to new buildings and to the renovation of existing buildings. This new initiative should have a large payoff, as it will increase the market for energy-efficient, clean and affordable buildings. Priority will be given to delivering new building technologies, materials and components for energy saving and energy generation, thermal energy storage systems, advanced insulation systems, thermal distribution systems, lighting, windows and glazing, energy generation systems based on renewable sources. Priorities also include reliable simulation and prediction tools, including assessment methods that integrate economic, social and environmental issues, including comfort and safety. To date, the construction industry has difficulty to effectively integrate key technologies into its operations in order to achieve sustainable, long-term competitiveness and such integration should also be promoted.</p><p>Activities supported under the EeB PPP are expected to contribute to EU industrial leadership and the grand societal challenges.</p><p>The participation of public authorities may be an asset for some projects, as public authorities own a large part of the building stock at European level.</p><p>The EeB cPPP will support a high-tech building industry which turns the need for energy efficiency into an opportunity for sustainable business, fostering EU competitiveness in the construction sector at the global level.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 27, 2017 5:00:49 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 27, 2017 5:00:49 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>FLASH INFORMATION ON THE CALL RESULTS</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>H2020-EEB-2016-2017 (2017 TOPICS)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Published: 14 October 2015<br />\r\nDeadline: 19 January 2017<br />\r\nAvailable budget: 54.88 M&euro;</p>\r\n<p>The Commission has now completed the evaluation of the proposals submitted to the above-mentioned call.<br />\r\nThe results of the evaluation are as follows:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nNumber of proposals submitted (including proposals transferred from or to other calls): 52<br />\r\nNumber of inadmissible proposals: 3<br />\r\nNumber of ineligible proposals: 1<br />\r\nNumber of above-threshold proposals: 13<br />\r\nTotal budget requested for above-threshold proposals: 75,463,464.18 &euro;</p>\r\n<p>We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals.</p>\r\n<p>For questions, please contact the Research Enquiry Service.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 25, 2017 5:13:00 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 25, 2017 5:13:00 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>Deadline: 19.01.2017</strong></span><br />\r\nA total of 52 proposals were submitted in response to this call. <br />\r\nThe number of proposals for each topic is shown below:</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\nEEB-05-2017:\t27<br />\r\nEEB-06-2017:\t10<br />\r\nEEB-07-2017:\t11<br />\r\nEEB-08-2017:\t4</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:32:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2016 12:32:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EEB-05-2017(IA), EEB-06-2017(RIA), EEB-07-2017(IA), EEB-08-2017(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 25, 2016 3:02:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 25, 2016 3:02:03 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2017 update</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>After the update to the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2017 of 25 July 2016,<br />\r\nthe following updates were made:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Open Access Data new provisions have been added for 2017 calls with an opening date on or after 26/07/2016.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The introduction of the call H2020-EEB-2016-17 has been modified. <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The indicative budget for call H2020-EEB-2017 was increased to &euro;54.88 million in 2017.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 19, 2016 4:18:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 19, 2016 4:18:48 PM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 153, 102);\"><strong>An overview of the following evaluation results (flash call info) is now available <br />\r\nunder the tab Topic conditions and documents:</strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>2016 topics</li>\r\n</ul>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 25, 2016 10:07:43 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 25, 2016 10:07:43 AM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(255, 102, 0);\"><strong>2016 EEB topics - Deadline: 21.01.16</strong></span></p>\r\n<p>59 proposals were submitted in response to this call.<br />\r\nThe number of proposals for each topics is shown below:</p>\r\n<p>EeB-01: 24<br />\r\nEeB-02: 5<br />\r\nEeB-03: 9<br />\r\nEeB-04: 21</p>\r\n<p>F<strong>or FOF and SPIRE topics see <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/calls/h2020-ind-ce-2016-17.html#c,topics=callIdentifier/t/H2020-IND-CE-2016-17/1/1/1&amp;callStatus/t/Forthcoming/1/1/0&amp;callStatus/t/Open/1/1/0&amp;callStatus/t/Closed/1/1/0&amp;+identifier/desc\">here</a></strong></p>"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
