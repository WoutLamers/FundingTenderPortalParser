So while research and the development of electric vehicle technology has progressed well, the integration of new technologies in the existing transport system still requires substantial effort, mainly in urban areas. The sound deployment of electric mobility in European cities and the realisation of a certain degree of alignment require the involvement of stakeholders at national, regional and even local authority level, who are in charge of the legislative and regulatory framework. Integrated with, but not overlapping, the European Green Vehicles Initiative, the ERA-NET Cofund represents a new dimension of Public Private Partnership. It ensures that the complementary approaches and means of national and regional authorities are appropriately included and receptive to research achievement from the industrial sector.</p><p>A European approach is essential to realise the ambition of effectively bringing electric mobility to the market: it allows key players to come together on a transnational scale; it helps to identify and to tackle the barriers holding back the introduction of innovative urban electrification products and services in the single market. Implementation of electrification needs to be increasingly based on partnerships that build the necessary scale and scope, and achieve greater impact from scarce public and private resources.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The proposed scope of the ERA-NET Cofund on Electric Urban Mobility reflects the progress that was made in previous years and consequently sets a specific focus on urban areas, where the next important steps in the innovation cycle will take place. Proposals will aim at the innovation and deployment needs for 2020 and the years after. Activities should focus on demonstrating and validating solutions that have already reached sufficient maturity for deployment. These should be complementary to, and not duplicate the scope of, the other projects of the European Green Car and European Green Vehicle Initiatives. Appropriate user and general public acceptance, regulatory, market up-take, social, environmental and resource efficiency aspects should be included. In principle all modes of surface transport are relevant. Urban freight and logistics is in scope (e.g. smart urban delivery fleets), but the focus will rather be on passenger transport (e.g. car sharing with EVs).</p><p>The proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national and regional research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Call content should take into account the European Green Vehicles Initiative to ensure no duplication of funding.</p><p>Participation of legal entities from international partner countries is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> may nonetheless request a Union contribution to cover the coordination costs of additional activities on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost.</p><p>To adequately address this specific challenge and generate a substantial impact, a call volume of EUR 30 million is considered to be appropriate (including a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 10 million).</p><p>Nota bene: Budgets should be determined in consultation with the respective initiatives to balance ambition in achieving critical mass and absorption capacity as well as aligning financial planning between MS and the EU.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>This action will result in:</p><p>\u2015Acceleration of the time to market of affordable, cost-effective and socially acceptable solutions to integrate electric mobility in Europe's urban transport systems.</p><p>\u2015Reduction of the environmental footprint and the energy payback time.</p><p>\u2015Strengthening the industrial technology base, thereby creating growth and jobs in Europe.</p><p>\u2015Tangible and practical guidance to the decision makers in the relevant authorities and support industry as well as the service sector to provide suitable and feasible solutions for electric mobility in European urban areas.</p><p>\u2015Contribution to climate action and sustainable development objectives.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Delegation Exception

Multi-sectorial research involving other research and innovation areas such as Energy and Environment coupled with research on new materials, advanced production and Information and Communication Technologies will be encouraged, particularly in fields such as advanced energy storage systems and interfaces between vehicles and energy recharging infrastructures.</p><p>In addition to the topics of this call, a topic on materials allowing affordable weight reduction of high-volume vehicles and its components, taking into account the entire life-cycle (NMBP 08\u20132016), is included in \u201cNanotechnologies, Advanced materials, Biotechnology and Advanced Manufacturing and Processing\u201d under \u201cLeadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies\u201d (LEIT).</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "May 16, 2017 4:17:40 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 16, 2017 4:17:40 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on the results of&nbsp;call H2020-GV-2017&nbsp;(Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "May 16, 2017 4:09:03 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 16, 2017 4:09:03 PM", "content": "<p>Please note that the latest information on results of&nbsp;call H2020-GV-2017&nbsp;(Flash Call Info) can be found on the additional documents section of the relevant topics.</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 14, 2017 3:07:59 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 14, 2017 3:07:59 PM", "content": "<p>On 1 February 2017 a total of 58 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2017 topics:</p>\r\n<p>GV-01-2017 &ndash; 4 proposals<br />\r\nGV-04-2017 &ndash; 14 proposals <br />\r\nGV-05-2017 &ndash; 4 proposals<br />\r\nGV-06-2017 &ndash; 5 proposals<br />\r\nGV-07-2017 &ndash; 8 proposals<br />\r\nGV-08-2017 &ndash; 3 proposals<br />\r\nGV-09-2017 &ndash; 2 proposals<br />\r\nGV-10-2017 &ndash; 10 proposals<br />\r\nGV-13-2017 &ndash; 8 proposals</p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 4, 2016 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 4, 2016 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GV-08-2017(IA), GV-13-2017(RIA), GV-06-2017(IA), GV-04-2017(RIA), GV-05-2017(RIA), GV-07-2017(RIA), GV-01-2017(IA), GV-10-2017(IA), GV-09-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:39:40 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 18, 2016 5:39:40 PM", "content": "<p>On 26 January 2016 a total of 21 proposals were submitted in response to the following 2016 topics:</p>\r\n<p>GV-02-2016 - 14 proposals <br />\r\nGV-03-2016 - 7 proposals </p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:05:40 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 15, 2015 10:05:40 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: GV-11-2016(CSA), GV-12-2016(ERA-NET-Cofund)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
