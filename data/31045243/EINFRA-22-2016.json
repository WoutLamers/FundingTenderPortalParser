It is also important to promote multi-domain community-driven approaches to fully exploit core e-infrastructure services with high economic innovation potential. With the support of, for example, independent software vendors, engineering companies, innovation clusters and Research and technology organisations, e-infrastructures should open up to innovative stakeholders, including researchers, citizens and SMEs, to exploit a wide range of technology developments, research results and data.</p><p>Opening e-infrastructures to develop and test innovative functionalities and advanced technology entails the support to Open Science and stairways for excellence to increase citizen's trust in science, bridging the gap between the leading research and education communities and the wider population.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><em>Proposals will address only one of the points below. At least one proposal for each point will be selected</em>:</p><p><strong><em>Exploitation of e-infrastructures for user-driven innovation and pilots responding to community specific challenges</em></strong></p><p>(1) Proposals are expected to support, through open e-infrastructure resources, specific requirements of European initiatives addressing societal challenges (e.g. on environment and marine sustainability, agriculture and biodiversity, health and human brain etc.). e-Infrastructures should enable fast prototyping and development of innovative networking, data and computing intensive application and services promoting adaptation, extension and repurposing of basic services. Special attention should be devoted to standardisation to make data and software reusable across the board. The network, data and computing services should lead to economies of scale and facilitate access to resources by innovators.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. </em></p><p>(2) Proposals are expected to stimulate the innovation potential of innovative actors, SMEs in particular, either as suppliers of technologies and services for e-infrastructures or as users of e-infrastructures to improve their own product and service offering. The proposals shall involve actions led by innovative actors (notably SMEs) for which financial support will be granted (minimum 80% of the EU funding requested by the proposal)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>. If the maximum financial support per innovative actor exceeds EUR 60.000 (it should however never go beyond EUR 150.000) the proposal should explain why this is necessary for the objectives of the action.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 5 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.</em></p><p>(3) Development of a pan-European identity federation services for researchers, educators and students, in compliance with existing identity inter-federation efforts (including <em>Eduroam</em> and <em>Edugain</em>). Stimulate AAI services supporting communities involved in the emerging data-rich science era to manage and share their resources. It shall respond to requirements of cybersecurity and information assurance towards integrated identity management across-disciplines and be interoperable at global level.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2.5 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. It is expected that one proposal will be selected.</em></p><p><strong><em>Innovation for Open Science e-infrastructures and services</em></strong></p><p>(4) Reuse and improve (performance, quality, reputation, etc) the open access repository and publishing platform infrastructure for prototyping new infrastructure services in support of open science (e.g. new forms of publishing, machine-assisted knowledge extraction services from heterogeneous data resources and strengthening of machine readability and other discovery services). Prototyping of open review and research certification services engaging researchers, educators and students. Also registration and archiving services can be targeted. Developing further and widening the scope of the European Open Science e-infrastructure. Proposals should address an open scientific knowledge management infrastructure in which scientific and educational information repositories and publishing platforms form a visible part of an inter-connected and global knowledge system. Proposals can target any relevant parts of the scientific information ecosystem to enhance the links between literature, data, software, models and other digital objects. The proposed prototypes should have the potential to become part of an interoperable framework in order to enable more efficient digital science as well as transparent evaluation of research and reproducibility of results. Proposals should consider barriers (including legal) to data sharing in the context of these new services and assess the possibility of using pan-European authentication and authorization infrastructures.</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 2 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p><strong><em>Exploitation of e-infrastructures for user-driven innovation and pilots responding to community specific challenges:</em></strong> These actions will accelerate the development of innovative data and computing intensive services in areas of social relevance such as Health, Environment monitoring and management. It will foster the use of open e-infrastructures eco-systems to innovative use promoting smooth collaboration among and between the large European Policy data intensive initiatives. It will bridge the gap between adjacent but not connected scientific communities and promote wide dissemination of data including to the citizens engaged in science. It will support collaboration in data provision and exchange across regional and national related infrastructures allowing the integration of data from a myriad of resources and research communities.</p><p>Successful proposals will increase the number of SMEs that are aware of available e-infrastructures resources and services and become active innovators as users and or suppliers of e-infrastructures. Stronger links between e-infrastructure operators and other actors in the innovation chain, such as independent software vendors, innovation clusters and Research and technology organisations, will be put in place. The value of existing scientific information infrastructures will increase with the addition of new interoperable and/or integrated services. Successful proposals will have an impact in making European and global intellectual capital available to researchers, business and citizens. This will support scientific advances now and generate innovation with economic impact leveraging e-infrastructures such as G\u00c9ANT. The knowledge capital will be better preserved for further exploitation by future digital-born generations.</p><p><strong><em>Innovation for Open Science e-infrastructures and services</em></strong><em>:</em> successful proposals will support the objectives of Open Science and contribute, with innovative services, to the modernization of the underlying e-infrastructures and improve access to content and resources through federated management.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=OpenScience;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Open Science</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=OpenInnovation;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Open Innovation</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>In line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Please also note that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;

Its implementation will be informed by the following principles:</p><p><strong><em>Service orientation:</em> </strong>The whole work programme aims at supporting a <em>service oriented European e-infrastructure landscape</em> catalysing new knowledge and innovative ICT solutions by global and multidisciplinary research. All projects will contribute to the production of a high quality catalogue of services describing the services that they will provide during the lifetime of the project or that they intend to develop during the project.</p><p><strong><em>Maximizing and assessing the impact of the e-infrastructures: </em></strong>Proposals should define, collect and make available key performance indicators (KPIs) in support of operational, technical and socio-economic impact assessment.</p><p>Proposals should plan for active participation in international <em>fora</em> and community-led consensus building initiatives to promote data and computing infrastructure interoperability such as the Research Data Alliance.</p><p><strong><em>Co-Design:</em> </strong>In order to successfully achieve the work programme objectives and to increase the scope, depth and economies of scale of e-infrastructures, the Commission encourages that consortia applying to all topics, in particular to those in the <em>platform-driven</em> and <em>user-driven</em> innovation themes, are composed by a balanced set of partners with complementary competences and roles.</p><p><strong><em>Open Research Data:</em> </strong>Producers and users of research data will benefit from more systematically opening it to broad access, depositing and accessing their data with the objective to make research data discoverable, accessible, assessable, intelligible, useable, and wherever possible interoperable \u2013 c.f. <em>G8 principles on research data</em>[[G8 Science Ministers Statement London UK, 12 June 2013 -<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1BtKagu\">http://bit.ly/1BtKagu</a>]].</p><p><strong><em>H2020 as a catalyst of the European plan for growth and jobs:</em> </strong>Horizon 2020 encourages synergies with other European Union Funds, with appropriate provisions not to cover the same cost items[[Article 17a of the Horizon 2020 Regulation and Article 31 of the rules of participation.]]. The e-infrastructures call for 2016-2017 will promote when feasible the combined and/or the cumulative use of other funding sources as instrument to support initiatives of European interest to foster growth and jobs[[\"digital game-changer\" on <em>European high-performance data networks</em>]].</p><p>The e-infrastructures call for 2016-2017 is structured along the following two themes:</p><p><strong><em>Theme 1 - Integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure platforms supporting European policies and research and education communities</em></strong></p><p>The integration and consolidation of e-infrastructure platforms covers the following aspects: (a) coordination of regional, national and European operations and funding (b) synergies between operational e-infrastructures (c) continuous upgrades of infrastructure without service disruption.</p><p>This theme will be covered by the topics EINFRA-11-2016 and EINFRA-12-2017 and the first point of the \"Research and Education Networking - GEANT\" part of G\u00c9ANT Partnership Projects (see <em>Other actions</em>).</p><p>The operation of e-infrastructure services will be funded by supporting the trans-national and virtual access activities provided to researchers. Those service activities shall comply with the conditions set out in Article 16.1 for trans-national access and Article 16.2 for virtual access to research infrastructures of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/mga/gga/h2020-mga-gga-multi_en.pdf\">Model Grant Agreement</a>[[For grants awarded under this theme capitalised and operating costs of \u2018large research infrastructures\u2019 as defined in the Article 6.2.D.4 of the Model Grant Agreement are not eligible.]].</p><p>Under theme 1, only platforms and services based on systems and technologies that have at least achieved Technology Readiness Level 8 (TRL8)[[Technology Readiness Level, See Annex G for further details.]] before the start of the project will be supported. The services offered under a project must be adequately documented in an open catalogue of services and shall be periodically assessed by an external board approved by the Commission and common to all EC funded e-infrastructure services.</p><p>The projects funded under this theme should establish links with all projects funded under the Specific Grant Agreement (a) \"<em>Research and Education Networking \u2013 G\u00c9ANT</em> \" within the G\u00c9ANT Partnership projects included under \"Other actions\", in order to collaborate and work on potential synergies, overlaps and gaps in the overall service offering.</p><p>Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section \u201cSpecific features for Research Infrastructures\u201d. Compliance with these provisions will be taken into account during evaluation.</p><p><strong><em>Theme 2 - Prototyping innovative e-infrastructure platforms and services for research and education communities, industry and the citizens at large </em></strong></p><p>e-Infrastructure platforms and services need to evolve through innovation actions to respond to the long-term needs of research and education communities, industry and the citizens at large. Innovative developments based on state-of-the-art technologies need to mature to be integrated and offered as dependable e-infrastructures. The support to e-infrastructure innovation is done by means of two types of activities: (a) <em>Platform-driven e-infrastructure innovation</em> (technology push, driven by the supply-side) and (b) <em>User-driven e-infrastructure innovation</em> (user pull, driven by the demand-side).</p><p>This theme will be covered by the topics EINFRA-21-2017 and EINFRA-22-2016, the second point of the \"Research and Education Networking - GEANT\" part of G\u00c9ANT Partnership Projects and the \"Interactive Computing e-infrastructure for the Human Brain Project\" (see <em>Other actions</em>).</p><p>Under theme 2, only platforms and services based on systems and technologies that have achieved at least TRL 6[[Technology Readiness Level. See Annex G for further details]] before the start of the project will be supported and it is expected that they will have achieved at least TRL 8 by the end of the project. This condition does not apply to point \"EINFRA-21-2017: Platform-Driven e-infrastructure innovation (a) Support to Public Procurement of innovative HPC systems, PPI\".</p><p>Further conditions and requirements that applicants should fulfil when drafting a proposal are given in part D of the section \u201cSpecific features for Research Infrastructures\u201d.
