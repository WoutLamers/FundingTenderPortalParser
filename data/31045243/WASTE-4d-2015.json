Insufficient cooperation between different value chain players in several raw materials sectors results in lower recycling rates or suboptimal use of raw materials from an environmental and socio-economic point of view. Improved cooperation within or along different value chains and among stakeholders, including a participatory role of citizens, representing the wider society, and civil society organisations, can lead to more efficient use of raw materials and to waste reduction.</p><p>The global nature of the waste management challenge requires coordination, pooling of resources and support to the definition of global objectives and strategies, and holds a potential for export of eco-innovative solutions and seizing new markets. Dissemination at international level of knowledge on waste management, including environmental regulations and standards, can contribute to turning waste into a resource at global level and to setting up resource efficient waste management systems and technologies and services, particularly in developing countries and emerging economies. To this end, enhanced forms of participatory processes for all stakeholders are needed.</p><p><u>Scope</u>: Proposals shall address the following issue:</p><p><b>Raw materials partnerships:</b> Creation of a common multi-stakeholder platform focused on a limited number of key raw materials across their whole value chain. This should involve partners from across the value chain, including mining, processing, recycling, application, public sectors (national/regional/local) and civil society, while respecting the conditions of each value chain. The action shall support implementation of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Raw Materials.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact: </u></p><p>In the medium term, better-informed decision-making at EU and national level as well as by industry. Increased EU raw materials knowledge and transparency of EU raw materials information, for the benefit of various stakeholders. Boosting the raw material sector through an interdisciplinary and transnational cooperation allowing matching the supply and demand from the EU downstream industries. In the longer term, improving availability of key raw materials, while creating greater added value to the economy and more jobs. Facilitation of exchange of information and increased knowledge and use of the most advanced, economically effective and innovative technologies in the whole value chain of raw materials. Contribution to the implementation of the EIP on Raw Materials.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u>Coordination and support actions </p><p>\u00a0</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
