This represents a departure from an approach of many different sensors residing on one satellite, in favour of many smaller single-sensor missions. It remains to be established for which areas of Earth observation (land monitoring, atmospheric measurements, water quality, maritime surveillance, emergency management, security,\u00a0 etc.) this approach might be particularly effective, be it in performance, risk management and cost effectiveness. Equally, it needs to be understood which technologies would be needed to allow a network/constellation to act as one instrument. Specific requirements for the sensors may also be needed to allow benefit to be taken of such mission concepts. </p><p><u>Scope:</u> Research should be undertaken to review the emerging fractionated observation system concepts. The required technology challenges as regards interfacing, synchronisation, formation flying, precision thrusting and pointing, communication within the constellation or with ground stations are to be identified. Potential benefits to be obtained (e.g. monitoring performance, risk mitigation, cost effectiveness, responsiveness) are to be examined in light of observation needs in different earth observation domains. Observation needs should be validated with the respective user communities to be fit for purpose in terms of scientific and commercial applications. Constellations of instruments might be of the same instrument type, or include a variety of different instruments and related data fusion approaches. Demands for data transfers and communication should be examined in light of current developments of high-speed in-space communication methodologies. The results obtained should enable mission designers and implementers to decide what missions should be initiated for which application areas, and the requirements for communications support. </p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 2.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> Proposals are expected to contribute to increasing the effectiveness of future developments by addressing </p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 significant advances in performance</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 greater coherency between different measurement sources,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mission planning parameters,</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mission scalability and incremental deployment.</p><p><u>Type of action:</u> Research and innovation actions</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application. <strong>Additional guidance documents which may be relevant to this topic </strong>are available on the 'Call documents' page.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: #808080\">,with the following exception: the European Space Agency will not participate in corsortia of proposals submitted under this call for proposals.</span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
