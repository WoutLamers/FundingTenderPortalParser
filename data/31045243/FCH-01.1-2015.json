Improvements of MEA components and Bipolar Plates (BPPs) are required for further cost reduction and to increase performance and durability of next generation of PEMFC stacks. MEA components comprise membrane, ionomers, catalysts and their supports, conductive electrode agents, gas diffusion layers (GDLs) including microporous layers (MPLs). Development of lower cost and durable materials (substrate and coating) and including BPP stable coatings may contribute significantly to meet cost targets required for commercialization.</p><p>A wide range of MEA components have already demonstrated their maturity for automotive application and many of them are commercially available. Nevertheless, integrated in a stack, these components do not yet meet the performance and durability at low cost requirements for a broad market introduction despite very promising innovative results achieved during previous projects funded by the previous FCH JU calls. The main reason is that different competitive phenomena occur in a PEMFC stack such as electrochemistry at catalyst and active layer level, water management in all components between bipolar plates and membrane, and heat management without a global optimization of the fuel cell core component architecture.</p><p>Therefore, there is a continuing need to develop existing concepts for the key MEA components such as catalyst, membrane, and GDL, through MEA designs and products demonstrating consistently improved performance (high power density), stability (lifetime with acceptable decay rates), and cost reduction (lowered precious metal loadings) that meet commercialization targets for FCVs. This approach is complementary to that targeted in the topic FCH-01.2-2014 \u201cCell and stack components, stack and system manufacturing technologies and quality assurance\u201d from the previous call as upstream developments.</p><p>In order to reach the OEMs\u2019 requirements for transport application, it is now necessary to design and evaluate strengthened component architecture based either on commercial or innovative components consistent with available industrial processes. To reach this goal, a special attention has to be paid to interface and interaction between all components with new integration concepts and designs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>In order to demonstrate the validity of the individual component improvements despite the competing electrochemical phenomena, demonstration of a full sized stack is mandatory.

These should be corrosion resistant, preferably compatible with higher temperature operation (about 120\u00b0C) and able to mitigate the consequence of fuel starvation events</li>  <li>Development of GDLs and MPLs designed for increased diffusivity, improved water management and heat conduction. GDL thickness has to minimized but be compatible with production in high volumes</li>  <li>Design of BPPs with optimised interface with new MEAs in terms of geometry, protective and conductive coating for long lifetime, corrosion stability and production process</li>  <li>Design of high performance MEAs using above components.
