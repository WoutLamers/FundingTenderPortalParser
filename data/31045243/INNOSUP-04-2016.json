The action aims at incentivising more SMEs to seize innovation opportunities arising from social needs or societal challenges, and thereby develop further solutions to those, in partnership with social enterprises.</p><p>Synergies between social enterprises and other SMEs remain mostly unexploited. Too often social innovators and entrepreneurs are isolated and encounter difficulties to find support, partners or investors. Too often they do not tap enough into the capacities of all types of businesses which could help with the development or commercialisation of such innovations. Too often their solutions do not translate into larger-scale projects, do not trigger significant changes in public policies, or do not inspire similar projects elsewhere.</p><p>This also stems from the fact that, while the great majority of social enterprises are SMEs, traditional support to SME innovation aims at maximising economic returns and therefore hardly captures social enterprises. Social enterprises need more encouragement and incentives to start innovation activities. At the same time, concrete social innovation needs and opportunities must be further communicated to entrepreneurs, SMEs and knowledge institutions beyond the usual circles of social enterprises.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The action provides for a new demand-driven tool for social innovation. The action will allow social enterprises to formulate their own societal challenges on line, to call for solutions and to select themselves the best idea(s) meeting their demand. Concrete challenges arising from real situations could thereby receive answers from any SME willing to engage in the field of social innovation or find a way to diversify its activities. Social innovators and entrepreneurs would tap into the creativity and capacities of the whole business community. The market uptake of the solution would be assessed upfront.</p><p>The action requires the creation of an on-line \u2018challenge platform\u2019 and its facilitation (i.e. allow the innovation demand and supply to meet). In addition, the action foresees a financial support mechanism that would allow solution seekers and/or providers to receive support to test feasibility and economic potential of the solution and proceed with its implementation (such grants shall not exceed EUR 50,000). The \u2018challenge platform\u2019 could be hosted on or combined with the existing <a href=\"https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/socialinnovationeurope\">Social Innovation Europe hub</a>, so as to minimize development costs, take advantage of the already established community and broaden the mission of Social Innovation Europe, beyond information sharing and mutual learning for which it was created. Synergies should also be sought with initiatives and platforms dedicated to specific societal challenges and of relevance for social innovation and with the Enterprise Europe Network in the dissemination of the needs expressed by the social enterprises.</p><p>Likewise social enterprises with innovative solutions could use the platform and the Enterprise Europe Network to promote their solutions and seek partnership with SMEs for their commercialisation. For that dimension, however, no additional grant support will be foreseen.</p><p>To address the above-described challenge, proposals should at least specify the following:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Developing and maintaining a web facility to allow innovation demand and supply to meet in a user-friendly and dynamic way;</li>  <li>Building a mechanism to reach out to a large number of stakeholders dealing with social or societal issues (and in particular social enterprises) about the potential of tapping into SMEs capacities and, on the other hand, towards the whole SME community in order to raise awareness about market opportunities offered by 'social innovation';</li>  <li>Assisting stakeholders dealing with social or societal issues (and in particular social enterprises) to formulate the challenges for which they need concrete solutions and to describe them as innovation opportunities, in a form suitable for all SMEs;</li>  <li>Describing a detailed mechanism to award and manage financial support to third parties (re-granting) already in their application documents, as foreseen in part K of the General Annexes of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2016-2017. At least 70% of the total grant amount should be awarded in the form of small grants to third parties.</li> </ul><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 3.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>The action will complement the European Social Innovation Competition for which the challenge is set upfront (see section on Other Actions).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ol level=\"0\">  <li>More SMEs engaged in the field of social innovation thereby finding new markets, creating new jobs and testing new business or growth models</li>  <li>More unmet social needs or societal challenges find solutions.</li>  <li>Concrete connections and further business opportunities are made possible between social enterprises and other SMEs.</li>  <li>More business intermediaries, incubators and investors engage in the field of social innovation, approach/support social enterprises and address their specific challenges.</li> </ol>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\"> </span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;

A strong rationale exists for public support to SMEs\u2019 innovation activities in order to overcome market failures specific to SMEs and to fully realise their growth potential. The public supports \u2018SME innovation\u2019 with grants, subsidised loans, equity and a wide range of innovation support services. However, SMEs receiving innovation support often remain dissatisfied with the services they receive; while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided. The nature of innovation is changing: open data, open software, open hardware design and crowd-funding make it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources \u2013 but the challenge arises from scaling these initial offerings to create growth and jobs. Social innovation is required at the interface between public services and private enterprise to maintain the high standard and security of living in Europe. While small enterprises face challenges in recruiting talent - among others as a result of increased mobility \u2013 researchers have problems pursuing academic careers and work below their qualifications.</p><p>As the nature and environment for innovation changes the public innovation support has not only to follow those developments but also become proactive in shaping them.</p><p>The following call for proposal is one element of a broader action to develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Where appropriate, a highly specialised support service may be established at European level to complement existing national and regional services. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, peer-learning and uptake of new approaches. In the work programme 2016-17 emphasis is put on testing three new approaches to a better innovation support in large pilot actions that should deliver results in time for the start of discussion on the next framework programme for research and innovation. The Enterprise Europe Network, present in all European regions and co-financed by them, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to play an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (4th April 2017- 17:00:00), a total of 73 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2016-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-03-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-07-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "content": "<p>H2020-INNOSUP-02-2016 SME Innovation Associate - at the closing&nbsp;date (30&nbsp;June 2016 17:00:00 BLT), a total of 192 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (6 April 2016 17:00:00), a total of 97 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>INNOSUP-02-2016- SME Innovation Associate: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate-essential-tips-your-application\">essential tips to applicants </a>were published.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-02-2016(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-02-2016: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/h2020-sme-_innovation-associate-presentation.pdf\">Additional Information for Applicants </a>are published on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate\">H2020 SME Innovation Associate webpage </a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-04-2016(CSA-CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-05-2016-2017(CSA-CSA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
