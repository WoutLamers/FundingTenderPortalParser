It aims at renewing ties between the different disciplines studying knowledge (especially beyond the 'declarative' and static action oriented kind of knowledge), cognition (e.g., perception, understanding, learning, action) and related issues (e.g., embodiment, thinking, development, insight, knowledge as a social construct, identity, responsibility, culture\u2026) from various perspectives (e.g., physical, biological, neuronal, behavioural, social, epistemological, ecological). The aim is to enable new synergies with engineering disciplines on smart and self-organising materials, embedded systems, robotics, hybrid systems or smart infrastructures and cities to take artificial cognitive systems beyond the level of dull task execution or repetitive problem solving. </p><p><u>Scope</u>: Proposals must address at least one of the following elements:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New concepts and paradigms in cognitive systems such as new approaches to embodiment, learning, motivation, autonomy, knowledge and mind, not limited to prior anthropocentric or bio-mimetic models. Proposals will aim to demonstrate these paradigms in robust performance of future robotic systems (possibly nano-, micro-, multi-, hybrid- or unconventional ones) in challenging changing environments, possibly co-habited with or linked to biological systems, and over long periods of time. </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Integrative studies of knowing, thinking, doing and being that bridge between low-level (e.g., neuronal, physiological) and high-level (e.g., belief, intention, identity) descriptions. These multidisciplinary studies are expected to go well beyond addressing the perception-action loop, and to tackle issues such as development, experience, understanding, empathy, memory, attention, the emergence and development of self, social belonging and culture. They are to be researched in close synergy with technological experiments, for instance in computational neuroscience, intelligent materials, robotics, cyber physical settings or large scale simulations that incorporate, test and refine insights gained.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Approaches for understanding the long-term development of individual and social knowledge and identities, especially in highly heterogeneous and dynamic settings (reflecting aspects of e.g., diversity, urban change, migration, social and gender divides, multiculturalism, inter-disciplinarity, etc.). Proposals are expected to take into account the role of technologies and infrastructures in this, as well as how these facilitate or hamper societal changes.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
