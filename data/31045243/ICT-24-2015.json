robotics market. The priorities in this specific challenge are based on input from the Public-Private partnership in Robotics[1], also building on the results of previous calls.</p><p>Collaborative projects will cover multi-disciplinary R&D and innovation activities like technology transfer via use-cases and industry-academia cross fertilisation mechanisms. PCP will further enable prototype development and stimulate deployment of industrial and service robotics.</p><p><u>Scope</u>:</p><p><b>a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>Research & Innovation Actions to advance key technologies relevant for industrial and service robotics </b></p><p>In terms of market domains, the priorities are: healthcare, consumer, transport.</p><p>The primary goal is to significantly improve the level of industrial and service robotics abilities in the context of the above mentioned market domains by addressing: adaptability, cognitive ability, configurability, decisional autonomy, dependability, flexibility, interaction capability, manipulation ability, motion capability, perception ability.</p><p>To reach this ambitious goal, key robotics technologies need to be advanced in the particular fields of cognition, human-robot interaction, mechatronics, navigation, perception. This includes technology combinations such as grasping and dexterous manipulation, physical HRI, mobile manipulation, reactive planning and other combinations, in particular those that connect the key technologies above. The priority market domains cover also enabling robotics technologies for disabled people; this applies in particular for people with upper, lower limb disabilities and/or amputees allowing them to gain functionalities with exoskeletons or prostheses.</p><p>To prove the exploitation potential of the results the project outcome is to be shown in market domain-relevant demonstrations proving an increased TRL.</p><p><b>b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>Innovation Actions: Technology transfer - Industry-academia cross-fertilisation </b></p><p>The aim is to gear up and accelerate cross-fertilisation between academic and industrial robotics research to strengthen synergies between their respective research agendas through joint industrially-relevant scenarios, shared research infrastructures and joint small- to medium-scale experiments with industrial platforms. Proposals are expected to demonstrate technology transfer in professional or service robotics, in application areas such as manufacturing, commercial, civil, agriculture, healthcare, consumer or transport.</p><p>Activities are expected to be clustered to facilitate a sectorial structured dialogue and to substantially improve overall impact. The action may involve financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes. In such case, the consortium will define the selection process for additional academic/research organisations, industry or end-users as appropriate to carry out the experiments in order to reach the objectives defined in the proposals.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b>c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </b><b>Innovation Actions: Technology transfer - Robotics use cases </b></p><p>Using leading edge science and technology, a targeted effort will aim at introducing, testing and validating promising and innovative robotics solutions in industrial and service sectors.
