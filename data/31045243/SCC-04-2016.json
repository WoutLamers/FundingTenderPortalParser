Finding solutions and defining optimal pathways towards sustainable urbanisation receives high priority in the Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) policy of the majority of the countries worldwide. In this context, aligning R&amp;I agendas to underpin sustainable urbanisation and implementing them through international collaboration will promote synergies, and thus an optimal use of the available expertise, capacity and resources, avoid duplication and ensure robust outcomes of global relevance. The opening of JPI Urban Europe to third country partners is increasingly finding interest among its members and among third countries. The Belmont Forum provides an excellent platform for international collaboration in the area of sustainable urbanisation.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing a joint call for proposals resulting in grants to third parties with EU co-funding in this area. Proposers are encouraged to include other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Actions should build on the international strategy of the JPI Urban Europe and launch in collaboration with the Belmont Forum at least one international call on sustainable urbanisation.</p><p>Participation of legal entities from international partner countries and/or regions, in particular with countries participating in the Belmont Forum, is encouraged in the joint call as well as in other joint activities including additional joint calls without EU co-funding. Participants from countries which are not automatically eligible for funding<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> may nonetheless request a Union contribution (on the basis of the ERA-NET unit cost) for the co-ordination costs of additional activities.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

A fast growing percentage (currently 72%) of the EU population lives in urban areas, using 70% of our energy. Quality of city life and the attractiveness of cities as environments for learning, innovation, doing business and job creation are now key parameters for success in the global competition for talent, growth and investments.</p>\r\n<p>Key challenges for Smart and Sustainable Cities are to provide solutions to significantly increase cities' overall energy and resource efficiency through actions addressing the building stock, energy systems, mobility, climate change, water and air quality. Such actions should bring profound economic, social and environmental impacts, resulting in a better quality of life (including health and social cohesion), competitiveness, jobs and growth.</p>\r\n<p>This &ldquo;Smart and Sustainable Cities&rdquo; cross-cutting focus area has the aim of bringing together cities, industry and citizens to demonstrate solutions and business models that can be scaled up and replicated, and that lead to measurable benefits in energy and resource efficiency, new markets and new jobs. The scope will include the creation of urban spaces powered by secure, affordable and clean energy, smart electro-mobility, smart tools and services, innovative nature-based solutions and showcasing economic viability.</p>\r\n<p>Particular focus will be on creating the right enabling frameworks for large-scale innovation at urban scale, including the development and testing of new business, financing and governance models that allow for quick replication at scale.</p>\r\n<p>This cross-cutting call on Smart and Sustainable Cities comprises two distinct but mutually reinforcing parts.</p>\r\n<p>Smart Cities and Communities (SSC1) focusses on demonstrating sustainable, cost-effective and replicable district-scale solutions at the intersection of energy and transport enabled by ICT. They should integrate smart homes and buildings, energy efficiency measures, very high shares of renewables, smart energy grids, energy storage, electric vehicles and smart charging infrastructures.<br />\r\nThe call continues with the 'lighthouse city' approach of the Smart Cities calls since 2014. The 2020 goal is to have a significant number of new lighthouse cities of all sizes all over Europe, in a very large number of Member States with various, climatic and economical positions.</p>\r\n<p>Sustainable cities though Nature-based solutions (SSC2-4) focusses on providing evidence that re-naturing of cities through the deployment of innovative, locally adapted, systemic solutions - that are inspired and supported by nature - can be a cost-effective and economically viable way to make cities more sustainable, resilient, greener, and healthier.</p>\r\n<p>This will also help to increase their attractiveness for citizens, new economic activities and investments.
