The Integration and federation of IoT with Big Data and Cloud (including edge cloud), having all three diverging principles, remains a key challenge. The exploitation of big data, being obtained from remote sensing / actuation and the Web and social media crawling in specific contexts and being processed by smart objects and in sophisticated clouds, enables the creation of distributed intelligence as key application/service drivers toward attractive IoT services. Cloud-based applications driven by decentralised information processing capabilities need to use dedicated cloud architectures, standardised APIs, open software components, and to pay special attention to data integrity, localisation, and confidentiality. Holistic approaches are required to address privacy &amp; security issues across value chains including privacy by design aspects, SLAs, software algorithms and new data management models.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><strong>Research and Innovation Actions</strong></p><p>The scope is to realise IoT/Cloud/Big Data platforms in social application contexts. Specific requirements include multiple sensors and devices linked with big data analytics and cloud data management, edge-heavy computing, machine learning and complex event discovery, and a programmable IoT logic and IoT Data Warehouse. The research will address technological issues in big data application scenarios such as: elasticity and scalability of cloud data management; transregional federated clouds; distributed storage; distributed and/or edge computing; wireless sensor networks; cross-sectoral and spatio-temporal data analysis; etc. Applications related in particular to smart cities supporting urban needs and green manufacturing should serve as test-bed and verification areas.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1.35 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately by two distinct projects. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li><u>Credible demonstration based on cross-border business and/or societal applications of </u>robust interoperable technologies combining IoT with Cloud technologies and Big Data approaches.</li>  <li>Concrete implementations of interoperable solutions that integrate Big Data, IoT and Cloud that are candidates for standardisation.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme with the following exceptions:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>Additional admissibility criterion:</u><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    - Participants in the EU collaborative projects are required to conclude a coordination agreement with the participants in the coordinated project funded by MIC (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) or NICT (National Institute of Information and Communications Technology).
