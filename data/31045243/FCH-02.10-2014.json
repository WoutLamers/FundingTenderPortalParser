Intelligent operation of the electrolyser in periods with excess or lack of renewable electricity production could help balance the grid and store energy. </p><p>This conceptual use of electrolysis is however faced with several challenges that are to be addressed by large scale demonstration. As for existing technologies such as central power plants the use of electrolysis for provision of grid balancing services alone is not sufficient for a feasible business case. Where power plants needs several electricity production hours per year to supplement grid balancing revenue, electrolysis needs multiple high value markets where the produced hydrogen can be stored, distributed and used. This is in particular of importance if green electrolysis hydrogen is to be cost competitive with central SMR fossil production.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Recent years of R&D have significantly improved the production ramp up and down flexibility of electrolysis technology and improved the scalability from kW to MW size. What is still lacking is large scale infield demonstration as sites where both multiple grid services are required and where hydrogen at the same time can be distributed and offered for multiple high value markets, such as e.g. industrial gases, transport fuel and power-to-gas. Only such applications can provide both the scale for providing grid balancing and reaching cost levels where additional revenue can be generated from hydrogen distribution and sales.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Little evidence has been gathered yet of the way electrolysers could operate to maximise their benefits to the grid and revenues from hydrogen supply to multiple markets. </p><p>This demonstration call seeks proposals which demonstrate state of the art electrolyser technologies providing and receiving revenue by providing these balancing services, whilst distributing (and receiving revenues from) hydrogen for high value markets.</p><p><b>Scope</b>:\u00a0 The objective of the project is to deploy and monitor state of the art (2015) electrolyser systems and supporting hydrogen distribution and supply systems configured to attract revenues from grid services in addition to providing hydrogen for multiple high value markets.</p><p>The scope of the project should include efforts such as:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large scale electrolyser in excess of 1 MW must be tested in order to be in relationship with the grid scale.

Correspondingly, the distribution and supply concepts for downstream hydrogen provision should show improvement on scale and current market utilization. In order to the hydrogen to final customers, activities may include the hydrogen distribution and supply systems and market access, such as innovative trailers and filling port and connection concepts at industrial gas customers. Safety of such innovative solutions shall be fully assessed, as part of the project. Additionally local hydrogen pipeline grids or power-to-gas applications can also be included\u00a0 </p><p>A technology neutral approach is envisaged, not precluding any of the different technologies.
