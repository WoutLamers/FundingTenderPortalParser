However, the lack of transparency of AI technologies and tools complicates their acceptance by users and citizens. Ethical and secure-by-design algorithms are necessary to build trust in this technology, but a broader engagement of civil society on the values to be embedded in AI and the directions for future development is crucial. This fact is generally correct, and it becomes extremely important in the security domain. Social engagement has to be part of the overall effort to fortify our resilience across institutions, civil society and industry, and at all levels - local, national, European. There is a need to find ways to build a human-centred and socially driven AI, by, amongst other, fostering the engagement of citizens and improving their perception of security. Possible side effects of AI technological solutions in the domain of security need to be considered carefully, both from the point of view of citizens and from the point of view of Law Enforcement: e.g., their concerns regarding a strong dependence on machines, risks involved, how AI will affect their jobs and their organisation, or how AI will affect their decisions. Many open aspects exist that can be a source both of concern and of opportunity and should be addressed in a comprehensive and thorough manner. Finally, the legal dimension should be tackled as well \u2013 e.g., how the use of data to train algorithms is dealt with, what is allowed and under which circumstances, what is forbidden and when.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals under this topic should provide an exhaustive analysis of human, social and organisational aspects related to the use of AI tools, including gender related aspects, in support of Law Enforcement, both for cybersecurity and in the fight against crime, including cybercrime, and terrorism. Points of view and concerns of citizens as well as of Law Enforcement should be tackled. Based on this analysis, proposals should suggest approaches that are needed to overcome these concerns and that stimulate the acceptance of AI tools by civil society and by Law Enforcement. Proposals should lead to solutions developed in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of privacy, protection of personal data and free movement of persons. The societal dimension should be at the core of the proposed activities. Proposals should be submitted by consortia involving relevant security practitioners, civil society organisations as well as Social Sciences and Humanities experts.</p><p>As indicated in the Introduction of this call, proposals should foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of around EUR 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Proposals should lead to:</p><p>Short term:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Effective contribution to the overall actions of this call.</li> </ul><p>Medium term:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved and consolidated knowledge among EU Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) officers on the issues addressed in this topic;</li><li>Exchange of experiences among EU LEAs about human, social and organisational aspects of the use of AI in their work;</li><li>Raised awareness of civil society about benefits of AI technologies in the security domain and opportunities it brings.</li> </ul><p>Longer term:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>European common approach for assessing risks/threats involved by using AI in the security domain, and identifying and deploying relevant security measures that take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, fundamental rights such as the rights to privacy, to protection of personal data and free movement of persons;</li><li>Advances towards the implementation of the AI tools and technologies in support of Law Enforcement, in the areas of cybersecurity and fight against crime, including cybercrime, and terrorism, by strengthening the civil society perception of the EU as an area of freedom, justice and security.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>1.

[[\u201cArtificial Intelligence \u2013 A European Perspective\u201d, EUR 29425 EN, 2018.]] There are many different technologies that fall under this broad AI definition and they very much refer to machine learning, data science, robotics, internet of things and use of big data. Furthermore, many applications of AI have already started to appear in our everyday lives, from image recognition to machine translations or music generation, or very soon might become our reality, such as connected and autonomous vehicles or medical diagnostics. However, it is not always clear how best to foster innovation and how best to raise awareness about potential benefits and risks of this promising technology. This uncertainty can be a source of concern but is also a sign of opportunity.</p><p>To address the challenges and make the most of the opportunities offered by AI, the Commission published a European strategy[[COM(2018) 237.]] in April 2018.</p><p>The Commission proposed an approach that places people at the centre of the development of AI (human-centric AI) and encouraged the use of this powerful technology to help solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges, such as fighting crime and improving cybersecurity.</p><p>In order to improve the competitiveness of Europe in AI, it is necessary to map the existing research excellence and to boost and facilitate technology uptake. At the same time it remains indispensable to safeguard the strategic autonomy of the EU when developing security systems using AI technology by finding ways of embracing the opportunities offered by AI.</p><p>In December 2018, the Commission adopted a Communication on Working together for Artificial Intelligence [[COM(2018) 795 final.]] containing a Coordinated Action Plan, which has been drawn up jointly with Member States. With the Coordinated Action Plan, the Commission intends to maximise the impact of investment at the EU and national levels, encourage cooperation across the EU, exchange best practices, and support the EU\u2019s global competitiveness in this sector. Security aspects of AI are prominently present in all actions of the adopted plan, from research until putting such technologies on the market.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission is committed to embed the discussion on the risks and opportunities associated to AI in a wider development strategy for security, taking into account various scenarios, needs, gaps and alternatives that are specific to each area of security.</p><p>Moreover, under the next programming period beyond 2020, the Commission proposed to invest at least 1 billion EUR per year from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programmes into AI based technologies.[[COM(2018) 795 final.]] With the Digital Europe Programme, the Commission has put forward for the first time a dedicated programme to reinforce the EU's digital capacities in key technologies that might be further complemented by other funding instruments such as the Internal Security Fund, the future Border Management Fund or by the European Structural and Investment Funds.</p><p>AI is also becoming a topic of interest for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in Europe. Many Member States and Associated Countries have on-going initiatives to modernize the work of LEAs in this sense. However, AI asks for a significant technical and financial investment, due to which smaller countries may lag behind. Bringing this issue at EU level provides several advantages, such as possible economy of scale, centralized solutions on the issue of huge amount of data needed, or development of EU standards in this domain.</p><p>In order to scale up AI capacities of LEAs across Europe, close their AI skills gap, create synergies and tackle more efficiently their major challenges, it is essential to reach a critical mass through a close cooperation among the LEAs, research teams and industry. In such a way, the initiative would pave the way for a possible future establishment of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement, as a gravitational point of all AI-efforts related to LEAs, which would also, among others, contribute per se to achievement, when appropriate, of a European Strategic Autonomy in this critical dimension.</p><p>Such a European AI hub for LEAs should build on the AI-on-demand platform and be, where appropriate, linked to it so as to facilitate sharing of new technologies and advances across domains.</p><p>In addition, such a hub would serve as a common reference testing and experiment facility (could be a virtual network of physical facilities) to test state-of-the-art technology in the context of LEAs, taking into account all the technical and non-technical constraints imposed by the field (economic, legal, structural, organizational,\u2026). This hub could also include regulatory sandboxes, in order to test practical solutions in environments where the regulatory context might need to be adapted or defined.</p><p>A European AI hub would support LEAs by improving their daily work and quality of the tools they have, by increasing the protection of these tools and of LEA infrastructures, as well as by diminishing the number and impact of technologically sophisticated crimes. Thus, four interconnected aspects need to be addressed within this hub in order to exploit various possibilities of AI to provide full support to LEAs:</p><p>1- How can AI help LEAs in preventing, detecting and investigating criminal activities and terrorism and in monitoring borders?</p><p>2- At the same time, in order to support LEAs in their work, how can the malicious use of AI tools for criminal activities and terrorism be prevented, including malicious use of the AI tools developed in point 1?</p><p>3- Then, how can the AI tools used by LEAs, including the ones in point 1, be protected against cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>4- Finally, how can AI help in protecting LEA infrastructures from cyber threats and attacks?</p><p>AI can bring benefits to cybersecurity and to the fight against crime, including cybercrime and terrorism, but will introduce new challenges as well, some of them related to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To this end, a close cooperation of different national Law Enforcement and judiciary systems is necessary in order to secure the existence and availability of large enough and up-to-date high-quality datasets at a European level.</p><p>All topics in this call will be subject to security scrutiny.</p><p>Projects under this call are implemented through the use of complementary grants. The respective options of Article 2, Article 31.6 and Article 41.4 of the Model Grant Agreement will be applied. Proposals shall therefore foresee resources for clustering activities with other projects funded under this call to identify synergies and best practices. This task will contribute to the actual set-up of a European AI hub in support of Law Enforcement at a later stage.</p>\n<p>The Commission reserves the possibility under this call to exclude a specific project from the delegation to the REA if it appears that that project would necessarily have a close link to the development of EU policies in the field of security.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 28, 2020 3:01:52 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">H2020-SU-AI-2018-2019-2020</span></b><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:&#10;12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:6.0pt;&#10;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\" style=\"font-size:12.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-ansi-language:EN-IE;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-IE\">A total of 23<b> proposals have been submitted </b>in response to this call.
