Individual SMEs are at a disadvantage to recruit specialised knowledge as they do not have the network Europe-wide and do not have as well-known brands as large enterprises. <em>Enterprise-led</em> mobility programmes, supporting enterprises in recruiting expertise, show a high level of satisfaction and return on investment. As this methodology is not currently used at European level, an enterprise-led approach is to be developed and tested through a pilot. This complements Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie actions (MSCA) which focus on developing research careers, by providing additional work opportunities for experienced researchers in innovating SMEs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This <strong><em>SME-led</em> pilot </strong>is an innovation capacity building action to provide at European level a grant to <em>visionary</em><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup><em> SMEs</em> which have experienced difficulty in recruiting the relevant skills nationally. SMEs are supported to employ a highly-skilled experienced researcher e.g an 'associate' for one year from September 2017. With their associate, these SMEs will explore for one year the potential of their innovative idea and turn it into an innovation project.</p><p>The action will consist of: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>SMEs are encouraged to publish a vacancy notice for highly specialised skills on the EURAXESS portal and other relevant platforms and media. This shall liaise them with interested specialist and be used to assess the attractiveness of the proposed package and help in fine-tuning their application to the pilot. SMEs would indicate in the vacancy notice their intention to apply for support under the pilot action<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> and an eventual conditionality of the job offer to the award of a grant. SMEs are free to recruit immediately interested specialists; this would however prevent them from receiving a grant under the pilot action. </li>  <li>The evaluation will focus on the demonstrated benefits of recruiting transnationally i.e. the impact for the SME to get access to skills not available on the national labour market; the excellence and impact of the innovative idea, as well as the coherence and effectiveness of the recruitment plan. </li>  <li>Once awarded the grant, successful SMEs will be able to advertise their vacancy on EURAXESS and other relevant platforms and media, with clear indication that the pilot grant was awarded.. </li> </ul><p>SMEs will employ for 12 months an associate to identify the potential of their innovation idea and turn it, or not, into a research or innovation project and hopefully further employment.</p><p>During these 12 months of employment, every associate is requested to participate in a core training programme on industrial innovation and business management<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. Also during that period, SMEs get financial support to implement a training and development plan specifically for the associate, tailored to the needs of the associate and the enterprise to make the associate fully operational in the company.</p><p>In line with the orientation of the action and with the aim to accelerate the integration of the associate in the company's staff, the following costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the grant: personnel costs of the associate and cost directly related to company's and the associates participation in the pilot action: in particular relocation costs of the associate, travel subsistence costs to the core training programme and costs, including travel and subsistence) for tailored training (as described in the personal development plan). Other costs like recruitment costs or travel costs to action specific workshops by the supervisor in the enterprise would have to be covered under indirect costs.</p><p>It is intended to support up to 90 assignments from the indicative budget.</p><p>The following criteria will have to be met by the associate: i) PhD holder, ii) an expertise in line with the job advertisement; iii) transnational mobility as defined in the mobility rule of the Marie Slodowska Curie Actions (MSCA). <sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup></p><p>The execution of the action will start on the starting date of the associates' employment, in September 2017 (exact date to be determined during the grant preparation phase). In case of non-execution, the Commission reserves the right to terminate the grant agreement according to article 50.3.1.l.ii of the General mono-beneficiary grant agreement for the Horizon 2020 programme.</p><p>The associates are expected to be offered employment contracts or equivalent by the hosting SMEs. It is expected that the 'associate' will commit him/herself for a full-time position, for the full duration of the grant.</p><p>To promote the pilot, innovating SMEs experiencing skills shortages will be contacted by the Enterprise Europe Network innovation consultants and assisted in formulating a vacancy notice to address the identified skills' shortages.</p><p>An accompanying study<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> will evaluate the impact of the pilot action and the satisfaction levels of awarded SMEs and associates as well as of a sample of non-awarded SMEs.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Demonstrate that</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>An idea can be transformed into an innovation strategy and a subsequent research and innovation projects once SMEs have access to the right skills; </li>  <li>Public intervention at European level, can support innovating SMEs to overcome challenges in accessing scarce skills through a transnational mobility mechanism, increase their innovation potential; </li>  <li>Experienced researchers develop appealing career opportunities in SMEs</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Vision: 'A statement about what the organisation wants to achieve in terms of innovation.

A strong rationale exists for public support to SMEs\u2019 innovation activities in order to overcome market failures specific to SMEs and to fully realise their growth potential. The public supports \u2018SME innovation\u2019 with grants, subsidised loans, equity and a wide range of innovation support services. However, SMEs receiving innovation support often remain dissatisfied with the services they receive; while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided. The nature of innovation is changing: open data, open software, open hardware design and crowd-funding make it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources \u2013 but the challenge arises from scaling these initial offerings to create growth and jobs. Social innovation is required at the interface between public services and private enterprise to maintain the high standard and security of living in Europe. While small enterprises face challenges in recruiting talent - among others as a result of increased mobility \u2013 researchers have problems pursuing academic careers and work below their qualifications.</p><p>As the nature and environment for innovation changes the public innovation support has not only to follow those developments but also become proactive in shaping them.</p><p>The following call for proposal is one element of a broader action to develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Where appropriate, a highly specialised support service may be established at European level to complement existing national and regional services. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, peer-learning and uptake of new approaches. In the work programme 2016-17 emphasis is put on testing three new approaches to a better innovation support in large pilot actions that should deliver results in time for the start of discussion on the next framework programme for research and innovation. The Enterprise Europe Network, present in all European regions and co-financed by them, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to play an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (4th April 2017- 17:00:00), a total of 73 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2016-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-03-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-07-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "content": "<p>H2020-INNOSUP-02-2016 SME Innovation Associate - at the closing&nbsp;date (30&nbsp;June 2016 17:00:00 BLT), a total of 192 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (6 April 2016 17:00:00), a total of 97 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>INNOSUP-02-2016- SME Innovation Associate: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate-essential-tips-your-application\">essential tips to applicants </a>were published.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-02-2016(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-02-2016: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/h2020-sme-_innovation-associate-presentation.pdf\">Additional Information for Applicants </a>are published on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate\">H2020 SME Innovation Associate webpage </a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-04-2016(CSA-CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-05-2016-2017(CSA-CSA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
