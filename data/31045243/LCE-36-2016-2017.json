Increased communication between research, industry and civil society actors will facilitate exploitation of research results and hence the deployment of high-efficient and competitive low-carbon energy technologies.

Projects can opt-out at any stage, that is both before and after the grant signature.</p>\r\n    <p>Note that the evaluation phase proposals will not be evaluated more favourably because they plan to open or share their data, and will not be penalised for opting out.</p>\r\n    <p>Open research data sharing applies to the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications. Additionally, projects can choose to make other data available open access and need to describe their approach in a Data Management Plan.</p>\r\n    <p>- Projects need to create a Data Management Plan (DMP), except if they opt-out of making their research data open access. A first version of the DMP must be provided as an early deliverable within six months of the project and should be updated during the project as appropriate.
