Advances in ICT in terms of high performance computing power and communication speed, smart sensor technologies for generating and exploiting \"big data\", the convergence of the embedded world and the Internet/Cloud world in cyber physical systems (CPS), multi-modal visualisation and interaction technologies, are leading to a new generation of modelling, simulation, forecasting and decision support methods and tools.

The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 2 and 4 million would allow this area to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Projects should be driven by industrial use-cases and should include proof-of-concept demonstrations for validation, preferably on real process chains.
