Various activities will be developed, such as benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, specific training linked to Science with and for Society and twinning schemes, not duplicating actions foreseen in the NCP network for quality standards and horizontal issues under \u2018Science with and for Society\u2019. Special attention will be given to enhance the competence of NCPs, including helping less experienced NCPs rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated in other countries.</p><p>Only NCPs from EU Member States, Associated Countries, neighbourhood policy countries, which have been officially appointed by the relevant national authorities are eligible to participate in and receive funding for this action.</p><p>The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs.</p><p>Submission of a single proposal is encouraged. The Commission will only fund one proposal under this heading. NCPs from EU Member States or Associated Countries choosing not to participate as a member of the consortium should be identified and the reason explained in the proposal. These NCPs are nevertheless invited and encouraged to participate in the project activities (e.g. workshops), and the costs incurred by the consortium for such participation (e.g. travel costs paid by the consortium) may be included in the estimated budget and be eligible for funding by the Commission</p><p>The Commission will only fund one proposal under this topic; with a duration to cover the first period of Horizon 2020.</p><p><u>Expected impact:</u> A more consistent, improved and professionalised level of NCPs support services across Europe helps simplify access to Science and for Society Horizon 2020 calls, lowers the entry barriers for newcomers and raises the average quality of proposals submitted. In the short term, this contributes to greater participation by SMEs and CSOs. In the medium terms, it contributes to spreading excellence and widening participation targets. Also, it contributes towards reaching the European Research Area objective of more integrated European research, via better coordination of Member States' own effort.</p><p><u>Type of action</u>: Co-ordination and Support Actions.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>This activity directly aimed supporting the development and implementation of evidence base for R&I policies and supporting various groups of stakeholders is excluded from the delegation to REA and\u00a0 will be managed by the Commission services.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<p>The budget breakdown for this call is given in the call conditions section of the work programme:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/main/h2020-wp1415-swfs_en.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/main/h2020-wp1415-swfs_en.pdf</a>.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme, with the following exceptions: Up to one project per topic shall be funded.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
