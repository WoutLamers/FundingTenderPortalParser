However the evolution of the current GEOSS information system<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> indicates that in parallel to this overarching goal there is a need also to strengthen the access to Earth Observation at regional level so that it becomes easier to harvest, consolidate and exploit those data at global level. The specific challenge under this topic is therefore to overcome the fragmentation of the European landscape of existing public and private Earth observation data infrastructures and to maximise their combined exploitation in the light of the evolving demand and supply of Earth observations in Europe. In order to meet this challenge a European data hub of the GEOSS information system should be developed taking into account the global trend towards more open data policies, the availability of new big data technologies and the requirements for the development of the European digital economy. The main function for such a hub would consist in harvesting available resources from relevant GEOSS data infrastructures in Europe and in particular from the distributed Copernicus data infrastructures. Developing such a hub would allow maximising and leveraging on past Community investments to support the GEOSS Common Infrastructure, in particular the broker technology, developed in the framework of several FP7 research projects<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. This would also help retain ownership in the evolution of this IT technology, which is at the cornerstone of the GEOSS.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This action will develop a GEOSS European hub consisting of an innovative web-based IT platform to provide users with a unique access point (gateway) to the diverse European range of Earth observation data (space-based and in situ data, from research and operational data infrastructures, across disciplines and communities) and services, as well as other relevant data sources such as socio-economic related ones. This platform should cope in particular with requests from European users willing to discover, access, combine and process multiple Earth observation data and information streams. Full interoperability with the GEOSS Discovery and Access Broker, with GEOSS data hubs developed in other regions of the world, and with environmental infrastructures associated with major EU programmes, legislations and initiatives shall be ensured. This applies especially to the Copernicus programme<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, the EU Directives related to INSPIRE<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> and the reuse of public sector information<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, as well as to research infrastructures such as GEANT and the EU High Performance Computing facilities. The GEOSS European data hub should be built in close cooperation with other national and European initiatives, in particular with Copernicus. Special attention shall be given to user-friendliness for multiple user profiles while ensuring system adaptability, scalability and robustness. At international level, this action should also contribute to the Community Strategy and Implementation plan of the Belmont Forum e-Infrastructures and Data Management Collaborative Research Action<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>The European hub shall be open to academia, the public sector and to the European private sector. Its core concepts of data federation and user customisation shall support an open ecosystem of services and business opportunities and build on past EU research investments in support of the GEOSS information system. Proposals should address the sustainability issue of this platform beyond the project lifetime and a governance model driven by the public sector with possible contributions from private entities.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 9 million and EUR 10 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The project results are expected to contribute to: </p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>improved user-friendly discovery, access and exploitation of Earth observation data and information in Europe; </li>  <li>strengthened European regional approach to GEOSS; </li>  <li>broader uptake of GEOSS and Copernicus data, information and services; </li>  <li>increased Earth observation-driven innovation and business opportunities for European SMEs and companies; </li>  <li>wider commercial exploitation of Earth observation data and products beyond sectors that are not traditionally engaged in Earth observation; </li>  <li>increased European capacity to address GEOSS societal challenges of prime importance to the EU such as achieving the post-2015 sustainable development goals or implementing adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>http://www.geoportal.org/</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>http://www.eurogeoss.eu/ http://www.geowow.eu/.</p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/space/copernicus/</p><p id=fn4><a  target=_self href=#r4>[4]</a>http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/</p><p id=fn5><a  target=_self href=#r5>[5]</a>http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:345:0090:0096:EN:PDF</p><p id=fn6><a  target=_self href=#r6>[6]</a>http://www.bfe-inf.org/</p>", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects.

This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nWithin this systemic approach, the Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' will focus on research and innovation which unlocks private and public investment in future solutions for a resource efficient, climate smart economy with a sustainable supply of raw materials. There is a consistent need to demonstrate Europe's potential for systemic innovation and market uptake of technological and non-technological solutions through large-scale demonstration projects. A transformative agenda on this scale requires major changes in attitudes and behaviour patterns and the contribution of social sciences and humanities will be essential to inform successful solutions. Complementary research and innovation activities are organised around the demonstration projects. Societal Challenge &lsquo;Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials&rsquo; will act as trailblazer for ensuring that the investment of 35% for climate action and 60% for sustainable development across the whole Horizon 2020 Framework Programme will deliver maximum impact for economic, environmental and social sustainability.<br />\r\nThis systemic approach is in line with Horizon 2020's Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) cross-cutting objective, engaging society, integrating the gender and ethical dimensions and ensuring access to research outcomes. The ethical dimension of the activities, including relevant socioeconomic implications, should be taken into account, such as personal data protection and privacy, protection of participants and researchers, ensuring informed consent, dual use and potential misuse of the research results, fair benefit sharing when developing countries are involved, animal welfare, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Given the transnational, global nature of climate change and the environment, and their scale and complexity, as well as of the raw materials supply chain, activities cover both EU level and beyond, thus contributing to the Commission's priority &lsquo;A Stronger Global Actor&rsquo;. International co-operation aims to boost the effectiveness of the actions promoted, within a scale-and-scope approach, e.g. GEO and the IPCC. Third countries, regions and international partners or programmes have been selected in order to maximise the impact and accelerate progress, e.g. the Belmont Forum. With regard to the broader international sustainability and climate change agenda, activities funded under Societal Challenge 'Climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials' are expected to have an impact on the implementation of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, as well as on that of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, France, on 12 December 2015 (The Paris Agreement is subject to ratification of Parties).</p>\r\n<p>The cross-cutting nature of the issues addressed by this Societal Challenge results in a number of research and innovation areas which can most effectively be developed jointly with other Horizon 2020 parts (Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and other Societal Challenges), and in complementarity with other programmes e.g. LIFE, the Natural Capital Financing Facility (NCFF) under the LIFE programme, or the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). Coherence and synergy with actions at national, regional or local levels, via the ESIF and links to EU Presidencies, and with other initiatives such as Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs) and the European Institute for Innovation and Technology&rsquo;s (EIT) Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), is also reinforced.<br />\r\nIn addition to the call H2020-SC5-2016-2017 'Greening the economy', activities relating to climate action, environment, resource efficiency and raw materials are also found in the calls:<br />\r\nH2020-IND-CE-2016/17 'Industry 2020 in the Circular Economy&rsquo; (on eco-innovation),<br />\r\nH2020-SCC-2016/17 'Smart and Sustainable Cities' (on sustainable cities through nature-based solutions),<br />\r\nH2020-BG-2016-2017 &lsquo;Blue growth &ndash; demonstrating an ocean of opportunities' (on the Arctic),<br />\r\nH2020-SFS-2016-2017 &lsquo;Sustainable Food Security &ndash; Resilient and resource-efficient value chains&rsquo; (on Earth Observation for Africa),<br />\r\nH2020-LCE-2016-2017 'Competitive low-carbon energy' (on applied geo-sciences) and in the SME Instrument call H2020-SMEInst-2016-2017.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Applicants can find additional information on the respective areas of the call in the text of the WP 2016-17.
