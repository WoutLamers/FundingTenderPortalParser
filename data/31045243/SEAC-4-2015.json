Two specific challenges are tackled in this topic targeting an open and transparent labour market for researchers by outreaching to industry and by building a human resources strategy for researchers.</p><p>There is a clear need to raise the awareness of industrial organisations (both large companies and SMEs) of the opportunities offered by EURAXESS Services and Jobs. Their expectations and possible demands to support the removal of obstacles hindering the collaboration between public and private sectors in research and innovation need to be better assessed and met.</p><p><u>Scope</u>:</p><p>This action aims at providing EURAXESS service centres with tools to increase the uptake/use of the EURAXESS portals and services by the industry sector. Initiatives shall be supported that have proven to increase the level of interaction of industry with EURAXESS portals and services for the benefit of Responsible Research and Innovation. This topic will support strategic activities to enhance collaboration with industry by EURAXESS Services Network's members that have signed the Declaration of Commitment. This shall include special IT applications for the national EURAXESS portals and mapping of specific needs of the industry sector. Activities such as trainings, seminars, networking and updating of national EURAXESS homepages shall also be part of this action. In this context information and guidance on Responsible Research and Innovation shall be provided for researchers & employers, taking-up and further the information and training material produced by the RRI Toolkit (Seventh Framework programme RRI TOOLKIT project). In cooperation with relevant projects and initiative, EURAXESS shall provide guidance on how making research open access can be beneficial for the career development of researchers as well as offering benefits to industry. Gender equality shall also be taken into account in the activities. Interoperability between national EURAXESS portals and the European one (especially EURAXESS Jobs) shall be foreseen.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 0.5 and 1 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u>:</p><p>It is expected that these new EURAXESS initiatives will significantly contribute to kick-start and advance careers of researchers. While making more industrial job and funding opportunities available on the EURAXESS Jobs portal, the second activity aims at contributing to improve working conditions for researchers, as institutional barriers are removed, in turn enabling them to focus on producing excellent research.</p><p>In the medium term the actions will produce efficiency gains for employers and open up the labour market for researchers. In the long term, the schemes will increase mobility of talent across Europe and from third countries into Europe.</p><p><u>Type of action</u>: Coordination and Support Actions.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<font color=\"#339966\">.</font><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
