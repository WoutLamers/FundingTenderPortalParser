The integration of highly differentiated materials and components is a key requisite for flexible manufacturing of individualised consumer/customised products. On the other hand, enhanced integration of sophisticated ICT-based components and of advanced materials implies a rapid product obsolescence rate, and can thus introduce further pollution risks if reuse of products and/or components is not improved. Therefore, reconfiguration and reuse of products, and related services, need to be developed.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>To face sustainability and flexibility challenges customised products need to be conceived, designed and manufactured in a modular way, and their single components have to be developed so as to be interoperable with one another during the product/service lifetime, so as to be exchangeable and updateable whenever necessary. This influences both the hard and soft requirements and calls for new production technologies that enable the fast manufacturing, assembly and configuration of complex products, as well as the products updatability and disassembly for re-use and end of life management.</p><p>In particular, consumer goods manufacturers should be able easily and effectively to integrate products and components which can be independently designed, produced and used in order to make diverse final personalised products in different production systems.</p><p>All involved actors in the product life cycle, from manufacturers of basic products components to retailers and vendors up to the final customers, should be provided with the needed hard and soft tools to reassemble and/or reconfigure the product or its components.</p><p>Research activities should address all of the following areas:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Methodologies, engineering and tools for the fast reconfiguration and re-use of personalised products and their components</li>  <li>New production techniques allowing for a fast manufacturing, assembly and configuration of complex personalised products</li>  <li>Innovative methods and technologies for personalised products updatability, disassembly for reuse and end of life management of the products as well as their different components</li>  <li>Methodologies and tools for the development of assembly, configuration, disassembly and reconfiguration services along the whole consumer/customised products value chain and along its overall life cycle also including the aftersale stage.</li> </ul><p>The proposals are expected to include use-case demonstrations aiming at the rapid deployment of the new modularity, reconfiguration and re-use of personalised consumer/customised products and life cycle management. All relevant value-chain stakeholders are expected to participate, including relevant Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) practitioners.</p><p>The resulting personalised products are expected to satisfy the final consumer needs at an individual level and consequently to facilitate daily life (particularly concerning elderly, disabled or other target groups with special needs) or improve workers and sportsmen safety and health.</p><p><strong>Activities are expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 5 to 7 and to be centred around TRL6</strong>.</p><p>This topic addresses cross-KET activities.</p><p><em>This topic is particularly suitable for SMEs.</em></p><p>This topic is particularly suitable for collaboration at international level, especially regarding the involvement of multiple actors in complex value chains on a global scale for consumer/customised goods.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The developed new technologies should lead to a significant impact in terms of:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Reduction of time to market of new personalised products/services by 30% through a modular product/service design and manufacturing approach</li>  <li>Cost reduction of the manufacturing of personalised products by 25% by decreasing lead times in product-services development and configuration</li>  <li>Reduction of environmental impact by more than 50% due to modular reusable components and final products</li>  <li>Savings of overall products/services life cycle costs by 30% as a consequence of the reusability and re-adaptability of the components of the personalised products</li>  <li>Wide adoption of the technologies developed leading to increasingly flexible manufacturing of customised products</li>

This focus area will bring together complementary activities, which as a whole will address the overall objectives of enhancing European industrial competitiveness and moving towards a circular economy.<br />\r\nActions will support the goals outlined in the Communications &lsquo;Towards a circular economy: A zero waste programme for Europe&rsquo; and &lsquo;European Industrial Renaissance&rsquo;, and are in line with the Commission's new Roadmap for a Circular Economy Strategy. They follow up the European Council conclusions of March and June 2014, in particular the Council's call for a systemic approach to cleantech.<br />\r\nThere are synergies to be reaped from working across different pillars of Horizon 2020 in tapping new sources of green growth and maximising the uptake of new opportunities by industry, including SMEs. These are expected to boost investment and job creation, and consolidate Europe's global green leadership.<br />\r\nThis call supports systemic innovation, which is understood as innovation that aims at responding to a societal challenge by obtaining a systems-wide transformation through affecting the system's economic, social and environmental dimensions. This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nThe industrial side of this call is based on the contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs) on Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industries (SPIRE), with a strong element on industrial pilot lines for nanotechnology and advanced materials. It will help develop and deploy the necessary key enabling technologies to support EU manufacturing across a broad range of sectors. It will help European industry to meet the increasing global consumer demand for greener, more customised and higher quality products through the necessary transition to a demand-driven industry with less waste and a better use of resources.<br />\r\nTo underpin the systemic approach, circular economy models play an important role as they boost innovation and involve all stakeholders in value chain(s) increasing resource efficiency. The circular economy is an economy in which production and consumption are organised in a way that the value of products, components, materials and resources is maintained or enhanced throughout the value chain and the life of the products. The circular economy decouples the creation of wealth and jobs from the consumption of resources (e.g. energy, water and primary raw materials), maximises resource productivity and minimises resource extraction and waste.<br />\r\nSpecific objectives of the actions in this call include a reduction of costs and emissions, a more efficient use of energy and resources, and a cascade use of materials. Pioneering new production and consumption patterns and related technological and non-technological solutions will strengthen EU&rsquo;s position and that of its industry in new markets. Systemic solutions need to be examined, developed and demonstrated throughout value chains, while addressing all influencing factors: policy and framework conditions that affect business and finance models; industrial manufacturing and processing; eco-design of products including design for repair, disassembly and durability, energy efficiency; reduction of GHG emissions; new and efficient use of primary and secondary raw materials; green and innovative public procurement (GPP); management, governance, social innovation; and new forms of consumer behaviour.
