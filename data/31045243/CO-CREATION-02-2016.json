Design-enabled innovation can be considered as a prominent example of \"user-driven\" innovation, where user involvement in the process is central, as in many cases innovation can better succeed through co-creation. User-centred design thinking and the application of design tools and methods, when applied to services, systems and organisations, enable structured service and business-model innovation, organisational innovation as well as other intangible forms of innovation. The focus is on applying design tools and methods, since this offers a systematic approach to conceive user-driven innovations.</p><p>The specific challenge to be addressed by this topic is that many public sector organisations and businesses, especially SMEs, miss out on the potential to utilise design as a source for improving efficiency and stimulating growth.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The consortium should plan and run a European pilot including selecting and allocating funding primarily to the concept development phase of the selected projects. Aspects of inclusiveness and social objectives of addressing inequalities in citizens' access to the innovations should be taken into account. The pilot should build on national and European level actions on design, incorporating a robust selection process to ensure that projects selected are likely to be further developed and implemented beyond the concept phase. The emphasis should be on practical experimentation, piloting and demonstrating activities as well as concept testing and incubating to improve organisations' processes, services, products or business models in the private, public or third sectors. Drawing on the experience of the funded projects, the pilot will a) gather data and metrics concerning the impact of design-related policies and programmes in terms of user benefit and business impact, b) develop a transferable methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of design in the innovation process, c) develop a methodology on how actors in different sectors can better connect with design-enabled innovation to increase efficiency and competitiveness in their respective sectors as well as a common impact evaluation methodology and respective indicators, to be applied across sectors and scalable to organisational, regional, national and European level. The activities could also involve showcasing success stories and disseminating the accumulated knowledge, particularly illustrating the applicability and potential of design-enabled innovation for all sectors, be they public or private or commercial or non-commercial activities.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU in the order of EUR 4 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. This does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes to the Work Programme.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Robust and commonly accepted guidance on embedding design in value-creating networks and identification of barriers and enablers;</li>  <li>Creation of data, data sets and metrics to evaluate impact regardless of sector;</li>  <li>The methodology developed and the analysis will contribute to incorporating diverse user perspectives into design policies and practices and for their further development and implementation.

Likewise, Europe can also count on its strong values, democratic institutions, its consideration for economic, social and territorial cohesion and solidarity, and its respect for the environment and cultural diversity.</p><p>Europe is facing the need to identify the obstacles to and to find untapped sources of growth and employment, renewing the legitimacy of public policy-making, especially through greater citizens\u2019 involvement, and of delivering better public services for all.</p><p>These issues need to be understood and addressed (cf. stronger evidence-base) in order for Europe to progress at socio-economic, political, educational and cultural levels, taking into account an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. An emerging approach for tackling many of these issues is to encourage creativity and collaboration between various societal actors through co-creation. It is therefore proposed to focus on co-creation for growth and inclusion: engaging citizens, users, academia, social partners, public authorities, businesses including SMEs, creative sectors and social entrepreneurs in processes that span from identifying problems to delivering solutions.</p><p>The potential for societal and innovative development through co-creation in all sectors of society is widely recognised and the current socio-economic context, despite many difficulties, provides for manifold opportunities to fully exploit it.</p><p>A clear link with co-creation and social innovation in culture may also be found in CULT-COOP call.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 9, 2017 11:43:22 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 9, 2017 11:43:22 AM", "content": "<p>Call : H2020-SC6-CO-CREATION-2017:</p>\r\n<p>An overview of the evaluation results (Flash Call Info) is now available under the section &quot;Topic conditions and documents&quot; for the following topics:</p>\r\n<p>&bull; CO-CREATION-1: IA</p>\r\n<p>&bull; CO-CREATION-4:IA<br />\r\n&bull; CO-CREATION-6: RIA<br />\r\n&bull; CO-CREATION-6: CSA<br />\r\n&bull; CO-CREATION-7:RIA<br />\r\n&bull; CO-CREATION-7: CSA <br />\r\n&bull; CO-CREATION-8: RIA</p>\r\n<p>H2020-CO-CREATION -3 - 2016 call :</p>\r\n<p>The call deadline was Tuesday 15 of November 17 Pm.
