Developing countries are also particularly vulnerable to water-related problems which are expected to be exacerbated in the future by more frequent and severe floods and droughts due to climate change. A prerequisite for tackling these challenges is a profound analysis of water resources at cross-boundary catchment scales, pressures on water resources and conflicts in water use that require sound approaches to water management, taking into consideration broader socio-economic factors and greater gender balance in decision making. International cooperation can play an important role in mitigating negative effects. </p><p>At the same time, the EU should aim to strengthen international cooperation also with emerging economies, especially China and India, through strategic partnerships in the field of water. This will allow for joint development of technological solutions that, capitalising on the mutual knowledge and experience of the water industry in EU Member States and these countries, have a great potential for further replication and market uptake. Building on its leadership in international water-related negotiations, the EU will promote its experience in water policy and river management in order to share best practices.</p><p><u>Scope</u>: Proposals shall address the following issue:</p><p><b>[2015] Development of water supply and sanitation technology, systems and tools, and/or methodologies</b> to manage risks associated with water supply and sanitation and/or cross-boundary water management issues, or integrated water resources management systems for sustainable agriculture and food security, sustainable environment protection and economic growth, focused on the non-EU Mediterranean countries and/or Africa. Proposals should connect to local knowledge, socio-economic development cultures, policy institutions and implementing bodies, and take into account the gender dimension where relevant. In line with the EU's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation[1] international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with non-EU Mediterranean countries and/or Africa. Proposals should include participation of organisations from the above-mentioned regions is considered essential.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2 and 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impacts</u>: </p><p>Application of innovative technological approaches/solutions adapted to local conditions, operational</p><p>and effective application of integrated water management, better identification of water vulnerability by</p><p>policy makers, advanced regulatory and economic instruments, improved capacity building of local</p><p>actors, and increased economic and social well-being at local and regional levels in the non-EU</p><p>Mediterranean countries and Africa. Support to internationally agreed water-related goals, including in</p><p>the context of the post-2015 development framework and Rio+20 follow up, by bridging the water and</p><p>sanitation gaps.</p><p><u>Type of action: </u>Research and innovation actions </p><p>[1] COM(2012)497</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=IntlCoop;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International cooperation</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
