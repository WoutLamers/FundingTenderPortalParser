It will connect scientists, stakeholders and citizens (including youth) in building shared understanding.</p><p><u>Scope</u>:</p><p>This action, which follows on from the Seventh Framework Programme VOICES initiative[1], shall develop and implement methodologies for pan-European and multi-lingual face-to-face participatory and inclusive workshops with citizens (including youth, women) and other stakeholders, to devise scenarios, visions and storylines in relation to desirable sustainable European research and innovation futures. The visions and scenarios shall consider future expected advances in science and their impact on technology, society, economy, gender, health, and the environment. The deliberations shall target at least three Societal Challenges of Horizon 2020. The use of support tools for the interactive exploration of \"what if\" questions, resulting trade-offs and scenario building, are encouraged. This should include a mix of participatory multi criteria analysis, virtual reality techniques, collaborative Geographical Information System (GIS), and integrated assessment modelling, to enhance citizen understanding and exploration of desirable futures. The methods shall take on a pan-European and multilingual dimension through their deployment in 28 Member States (and some selected Associate Countries). In parallel to the face-to-face workshops, a dedicated participatory on-line consultation shall be launched (building e.g. on relevant Eurobarometer studies). The outcomes of the consultations shall be compared with those from other expert-based foresight and prospective studies to assess the relative merits of citizen focussed consultations for inspiring research and innovation policy development and implementation. The outcome of this topic shall provide inputs to the 2017 and beyond Horizon 2020 Work programmes and other relevant EU policy initiatives.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of the order of EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in Part K of the General Annexes.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u>:</p><p>In the immediate future, this action will generate further engagement of citizens and scientific stakeholders in envisioning socially desirable futures, with a view of inspiring future research, innovation and public policies as a means to achieve these futures. In the medium term, it will contribute to enhanced understanding of the likely effects of scientific progress, to increased scientific literacy in society, and will enhance policy-makers' ability to set scientific courses in line with societal needs and aspirations. </p><p><u>Type of action</u>: Coordination and Support Actions.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[1] See: http://www.voicesforinnovation.eu/</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme, with the following exceptions: The specific eligibility conditions are the following: The consortium must consist of at least 10 independent legal entities established in at least 10 different EU Member States or Associated Countries.
