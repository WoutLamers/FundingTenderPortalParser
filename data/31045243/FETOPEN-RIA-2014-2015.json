for the successful exploration of new foundations for radically new future technologies. Nurturing fragile ideas requires an agile, risk-friendly and highly interdisciplinary research approach, expanding well beyond the strictly technological disciplines. Recognising and stimulating the driving role of new high-potential actors in research and innovation, such as women, young researchers and high-tech SMEs, is also important for nurturing the scientific and industrial leaders of the future.</p><p><u>Scope</u>: Proposals are sought for collaborative research with all of the following characteristics:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Long-term vision</b>: the research proposed must address a new, original or radical long-term vision of technology-enabled possibilities that are far beyond the state of the art and currently not anticipated by technology roadmaps.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Breakthrough S&T target</b>: research must target scientifically ambitious and technologically concrete breakthroughs that are arguably crucial steps towards achieving the long-term vision and that are plausibly attainable within the life-time of the proposed project.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Foundational</b>: the breakthroughs that are envisaged must be foundational in the sense that they can establish a basis for a new line of technology not currently anticipated.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>Novelty</b>: the research proposed must find its plausibility in new ideas and concepts, rather than in the application or incremental refinement of existing ones.</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <b>High-risk</b>: the potential of a new technological direction depends on a whole range of factors that cannot be apprehended from a single disciplinary viewpoint.

Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u>: Proposals must aim at one of the following two impacts:</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiating a radically new line of technology by establishing Proof-of-Principle of a new technological possibility and its new scientific underpinning, or</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kick-starting an emerging innovation eco-system of high-potential actors around a solid baseline of feasibility and potential for a new technological option, ready for early take-up.</p><p>The active involvement of new and high-potential research and innovation players, which may become the European scientific and technological leaders of the future, is encouraged.

FET research aims at accelerating the transition from upstream research to technology development. Due to this specific nature of FET research, FET applies specific evaluation criteria.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Thresholds and weights are set for each criterion, as indicated in the table below. A proposal failing to achieve any of these threshold scores will not be funded.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Subcriteria for evaluation criterion 1 &quot;Excellence&quot;:<br />\r\n    * Clarity of targeted breakthrough and its specific science and technology contributions towards a long-term vision. <br />\r\n    * Novelty, level of ambition and foundational character.<br />\r\n    * Range and added value from interdisciplinarity. <br />\r\n    * Appropriatness of the research methods.<br />\r\n    Threshold for this criterion: 4/5<br />\r\n    Weight for this criterion: 60%<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Subcriteria for evaluation criterion 2 &quot;Impact&quot;:<br />\r\n    * Importance of the new technological outcome with regards to its transformational impact on technology and/or society.<br />\r\n    * Quality of measures for achieving impact on science, technology and/or society.<br />\r\n    * Impact from empowerment of new and high potential actors towards future technological leadership.<br />\r\n    Threshold for this criterion: 3.5/5<br />\r\n    Weight for this criterion: 20%<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Subcriteria for evaluation criterion 3 &quot;Quality and efficiency of the implementation&quot;:<br />\r\n    * Quality of the workplan and clarity of intermediate targets.<br />\r\n    * Relevant expertise in the consortium.<br />\r\n    * Appropriate allocation and justification of resources (person-months, equipment, budget).<br />\r\n    Threshold for this criterion: 3/5<br />\r\n    Weight for this criterion: 20%<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Specific evaluation procedure: <br />\r\n    At consensus stage, the consensus score for each evaluation criteria will be the median of the corresponding scores attributed by the individual evaluators and the consensus report will comprise a collation of the comments from individual reports, or extracts from them.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The procedure for setting a priority order for proposals with the same score is given in part H of the General Annexes of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    <span style=\"color: rgb(51,153,102)\">&nbsp;</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.2</span></strong> <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/pse/h2020-guide-pse_en.pdf\">Guide to the submission and evaluation process</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: #003366\">3.3</span></strong><span style=\"color: #003366\"> </span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/pse/h2020-evaluation-faq_en.pdf\">Guidance on the evaluation of innovation. social sciences and humanities and other aspects of H2020 proposals</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Proposal page limits and layout: </span></strong>Please&nbsp;see eligibility conditions above.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement:</strong></span><br />\r\n    Information on the outcome of&nbsp;the evaluation: maximum 5 months from the final date for submission.<br />\r\n    Signature of grant agreements: maximum 3 months from the date of informing successful applicants.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type(s) of action(s) under this topic: </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <u>Research and Innovation Action:\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-d-ria_en.pdf\">Specific provisions and funding rates </a><br />\r\n    For this topic you must use the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_ptef/pt/h2020-call-pt-ria-ia_fetopen-fetproact_en.pdf\">specific proposal template Part B of topic FETOPEN-1-2014/2015 &quot;FET-Open research projects&quot;</a><br />\r\n    For this topic, in addition to the standard criteria, specific evaluation subcriteria (indicated above) apply.
