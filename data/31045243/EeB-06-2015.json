Transformation of our existing building stock towards very low energy buildings and nearly zero energy and Plus-energy buildings requires effective integration and full use of the potential yield of renewable energy.\u00a0 Thermal storage is a key priority to make such a step, particularly considering the energy renovation of the existing stock, where compact building level solutions are required.</p><p><u>Scope:</u>Proposals should address advanced solutions required to reduce thermal losses, reduce pressure drops, and improve heat exchange in and between storage material and heat carrier. Having in mind a system approach, innovations are required at different levels. High energy density storage materials are needed in terms of long term multi-cyclic stability at tuneable temperature levels. These advanced energy storage materials should allow regeneration temperatures in a range below 100<sup>o</sup>C to enable a higher efficiency and effectiveness of thermal energy storage of at least 6 times the energy storage density of water. Furthermore, an additional innovation may concern storage reactor components, in particular the heat exchanger. With respect to the entire storage system, advanced energy management is needed, including smart algorithms for (dis)charging at different temperatures, and simple and robust control equipment. These storage solutions should be enabled by material innovations that are safe and environmentally friendly. </p><p>Small scale demonstration of the technical (with compactness as a crucial boundary condition) and economic feasibility of such storage systems at the level of components and systems in relation to space heating and cooling and/or domestic hot water systems of a single building are expected, validating a systemic approach in system integration and scalability in near real life operating conditions.</p><p>For this topic, proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation and business plans, which will be developed further in the proposal project.</p><p>Activities expected to focus on Technology Readiness Levels 4-6. </p><p><i>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 3 and 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.
