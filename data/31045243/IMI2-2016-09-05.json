Identifying and validating these biomarkers will be crucial in furthering an understanding of the factors that drive the heterogeneity of NAFLD and in enabling accurate diagnosis of those with NASH. The ultimate challenge that will be addressed is to validate one or more NAFLD biomarkers that can serve as surrogates for development of clinically meaningful outcomes.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The scope of this proposed biomarker collaborative research for NAFLD and NASH will encompass development of diagnostic and staging biomarkers that can separate NASH from NAFLD, and more specifically, identify the presence and severity of inflammation and fibrosis. This will serve to help identify the most appropriate population for a particular treatment. Secondly, development of biomarkers that can predict progression<em>. </em>It is recognized that in general, NASH progresses slowly toward End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD). However, there do appear to be subgroups that progress fairly rapidly. Accordingly, there is a need to qualify biomarkers that can identify \u201cfast progressors\u201d amongst those who meet criteria for a diagnosis of NASH. Finally, the ultimate goal of this biomarker research is to provide evidence supporting the regulatory acceptance of non-invasive biomarkers as surrogates for clinically important endpoints. It will be a long-term goal of this collaborative research to validate biomarkers that reliably identify and predict risk for cirrhosis and complications of ESLD (e.g. varices, ascites) and that reliably identify and predict risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>It is expected that this program to identify and qualify non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD and NASH will be transformative for clinical management of patients and profoundly enabling for drug development for treatment of NASH. Accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are the twin pillars that support medical practice and the unmet need that is present with regard to NAFLD and NASH cannot be effectively addressed without the elucidation of validated biomarkers.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application !</p>\r\n<p>You can access the description of the&nbsp;different topics in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_fiches/jtis/h2020-call-fiche16-9-imi2-ju_en.pdf\">IMI2&nbsp;Call 9 topics text&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p>The budget breakdown for this Call is given at the end&nbsp;of the Call topics text, in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_fiches/jtis/h2020-call-fiche16-9-imi2-ju_en.pdf\">Call Conditions </a>section (starting page 61), as well as the following information :</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding</span></strong><br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions<br />\r\n    </span></strong></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation criteria and procedure, scoring and threshold:</span></strong> described in&nbsp;the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-pse-imi-ju-v1.3_en.pdf\">Manual for submission, evaluation and grant award</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\"><strong>Indicative timetable for evaluation and grant agreement<br />\r\n    </strong></span></li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Provisions, proposal templates and evaluation forms for the type of action under this topic:</span></strong> <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><u>IMI2 Research and Innovation Action (IMI2-RIA) and (IMI2-IA):</u><br />\r\n    </strong><br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/guides_for_applicants/jtis/h2020-guide-rel-prov-imi-ju_en.pdf\">Summary of the most relevant provisions for participating in IMI2 actions</a><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/call_ptef/ef/h2020-call-ef-imi2-ria-ia-2016_en.pdf\">Standard evaluation form</a><br />\r\n    Proposal templates are available after entering the submission tool SOFIA.<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/mga/jtis/h2020-mga-imi_en.pdf\">IMI2 Model Grant Agreement</a><br />\r\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/templ/h2020_tmpl-clinical-studies-imi-ju_en.pdf\">Template for Essential Clinical Trials Information</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>", "supportInfo": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/index_en.htm\">H2020 Online Manual</a></strong> your online guide on the procedures from proposal submission to managing your grant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Contact the IMI&nbsp;JU&nbsp;Programme Office : <a href=\"mailto:Infodesk@imi.europa.eu\">Infodesk@imi.europa.eu</a> Tel : 0032 (2) 221 81 81</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Contact the IMI&nbsp;SOFIA&nbsp;Helpdesk for questions such as forgotten passwords, access rights and roles, technical aspects of submission of proposals, etc. : <a href=\"mailto:sofia@imi.europa.eu\">sofia@imi.europa.eu</a> </span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/support/faq.html\">Participant Portal FAQ</a> </span></strong><span>&ndash; Submission of proposals.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal4/desktop/en/support/national_contact_points.html\">National Contact Points (NCP)</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></strong><span>contact your NCP for further assistance.</span><br />\r\n<strong><br />\r\n<span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/index.cfm?lg=en&amp;pg=enquiries\">Research Enquiry Service</a></span></strong><span> &ndash; ask questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular.</span><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://een.ec.europa.eu/\"><br />\r\n<strong>Enterprise Europe Network</strong></a> &ndash; contact your EEN national contact for advice to businesses with special focus on SMEs.
