The topic will support fast adoption, and wide spread technology transfer of advanced ICT-based solutions for manufacturing across the business process chains \u2013 from \"cradle to grave\".</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>As Phase 3 of I4MS (www.i4ms.eu) this topic addresses the adoption of the next generation of ICT advances in the manufacturing domain. Focus is on emerging innovative technologies and processes, which need to be customised, integrated, tested and validated before being released on the market. Special emphasis is on strengthening European SMEs and mid-caps along the value chain by adopting new concepts linked to innovative business and/or service models, and bringing them into contact with actors that can provide access to finance and access to advanced training to reskill workers.</p><p><strong>a. Innovation actions</strong> must address all of the following three aspects.</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li>Establishing across Europe networks of multidisciplinary competence centres offering \u201cmarketplaces\u201d for companies that want to experiment with digital technologies in manufacturing of discrete or continuous goods. Centres should have the capacity to offer access to technology platforms and skills for developing and testing innovative technologies and applications, including access to design and manufacturing, rapid prototyping and equipment assessment initiatives. They should also act as brokers between suppliers and users of the technology products. Competence centres are encouraged to link to existing/emerging regional (smart specialisation) or national innovation hubs. If Horizon 2020 funding is complemented by ESIF or other regional or national funds: Horizon 2020 funding shall be used for carrying out highly innovative experiments that will multiply the impact of local initiatives to a European scale, and will build partnerships between businesses in Europe.</li>  <li>Carrying out a critical mass of cross-border experiments bringing together different key actors along the full value chain to customise the technologies according to the requirements of the users. Driven by the requirements of first-time users, <strong>Application Experiments</strong> bring together the actors of the value chain and the experts necessary to enable new users to develop novel products or services and assist them in customising and applying these in their respective environments. Experiment descriptions in proposals should include an outline of the initial exploitation plan and business scenario, which will be developed further in the proposed experiment. To remain flexible on which experiments will be carried out, the action may involve financial support to third parties, in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes. The consortium will define the selection process of additional users and suppliers running the experiments for which financial support will be granted (typically in the order of EUR 20 000 \u2013 100 000<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> per party). Maximum 50% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</li>  <li>Activities to achieve long-term sustainability of the competence centres and the eco-system. This includes the development of a business plan for the competence centres and the marketplace, of which an outline business case and industrial exploitation strategy should be described in the proposal, as outlined in the Introduction to the LEIT part of this Work Programme. In addition, investors should be attracted to support business development of SMEs and mid-cap actors in successful experiments. Training needs of the SMEs and mid-caps should be collected and shared with training providers in the eco-system, with the ultimate aim that sufficient training opportunities will be available for all companies.Such activities would include also dissemination.</li> </ol><p>Proposers should cover at least one of the following four areas of technologies for adoption in manufacturing. Proposers are encouraged to support the building of pan-European ecosystems of emerging platforms and are expected to collaborate on reinforcing the European I4MS ecosystem, and to establish links to related activities, e.g. in the IoT Focus Area, the Joint Undertaking ECSEL, and the SPARC or big data PPPs.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\" level=\"0\">  <li><strong>CPS and IoT:</strong> Adoption and piloting of CPS/IoT in smart production environments, with special focus on scalable, modular and re-configurable automation systems across the process chain especially for SMEs.</li>  <li><strong>Robotics</strong><sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup><strong>:</strong> New robot systems that are cost effective at lower lot sizes, with the benefit of long-term improvements in productivity, the ability to work safely in close physical collaboration with human operators; and that are intuitive to use and adaptive to changes in task configuration. Key for fast adoption is the availability of flexible and easy to apply material feeding solutions. Step changes to at least two of the following abilities are therefore considered necessary: configurability, interaction capability, decisional autonomy in terms of context-awareness, and dependability.</li>  <li><strong>Modelling, simulation and analytics</strong>: HPC Cloud-based modelling, simulation and analytics services with special emphasis on sustained service models; on providing real-time support; and on addressing comprehensively security and privacy issues at all levels.</li>  <li><strong>Digital design for additive Manufacturing</strong>: Supporting the broad uptake of innovative additive manufacturing equipment and processes particularly focusing on the link between design tools and production, changes in business models, process chains and stakeholder relations.</li> </ol><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU up to EUR 8 million would allow the areas to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. At least one innovation action is supported for each area of technologies.</p><p><strong>b. Coordination and Support actions</strong></p><p>To advance the European I4MS innovation ecosystem the network is to be reinforced. The aim is to achieve broad coverage in technological, application, innovation, and geographic terms, and to link up with regional/national innovation initiatives, including access to finance and access to training.

This focus area will bring together complementary activities, which as a whole will address the overall objectives of enhancing European industrial competitiveness and moving towards a circular economy.<br />\r\nActions will support the goals outlined in the Communications &lsquo;Towards a circular economy: A zero waste programme for Europe&rsquo; and &lsquo;European Industrial Renaissance&rsquo;, and are in line with the Commission's new Roadmap for a Circular Economy Strategy. They follow up the European Council conclusions of March and June 2014, in particular the Council's call for a systemic approach to cleantech.<br />\r\nThere are synergies to be reaped from working across different pillars of Horizon 2020 in tapping new sources of green growth and maximising the uptake of new opportunities by industry, including SMEs. These are expected to boost investment and job creation, and consolidate Europe's global green leadership.<br />\r\nThis call supports systemic innovation, which is understood as innovation that aims at responding to a societal challenge by obtaining a systems-wide transformation through affecting the system's economic, social and environmental dimensions. This implies a trans-disciplinary perspective that integrates technology, business models and economic organisation, finance, governance and regulation as well as skills and social innovation. Systemic innovation therefore calls for the adoption of a challenge-driven, solutions-oriented research and innovation strategy that crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves co-creation of knowledge and co-delivery of outcomes with economic, industrial and research actors, public authorities and/or civil society.<br />\r\nThe industrial side of this call is based on the contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs) on Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industries (SPIRE), with a strong element on industrial pilot lines for nanotechnology and advanced materials. It will help develop and deploy the necessary key enabling technologies to support EU manufacturing across a broad range of sectors. It will help European industry to meet the increasing global consumer demand for greener, more customised and higher quality products through the necessary transition to a demand-driven industry with less waste and a better use of resources.<br />\r\nTo underpin the systemic approach, circular economy models play an important role as they boost innovation and involve all stakeholders in value chain(s) increasing resource efficiency. The circular economy is an economy in which production and consumption are organised in a way that the value of products, components, materials and resources is maintained or enhanced throughout the value chain and the life of the products. The circular economy decouples the creation of wealth and jobs from the consumption of resources (e.g. energy, water and primary raw materials), maximises resource productivity and minimises resource extraction and waste.<br />\r\nSpecific objectives of the actions in this call include a reduction of costs and emissions, a more efficient use of energy and resources, and a cascade use of materials. Pioneering new production and consumption patterns and related technological and non-technological solutions will strengthen EU&rsquo;s position and that of its industry in new markets.
