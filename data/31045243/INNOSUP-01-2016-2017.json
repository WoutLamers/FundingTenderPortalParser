The EU needs to support the development of emerging industries, which will provide the growth and employment of the future. The reindustrialisation of the EU's industrial base has to focus on the development of long-term internationally competitive goods and services that require combining different competences and innovative solutions. The development of new industrial value chains calls for the collaboration and integration of different innovation actors, including large enterprises and especially SMEs, across different sectors towards the implementation of a joint vision.</p><p>SMEs need help to generate, take up and better capitalise on all forms of knowledge, creativity, craftsmanship and innovation \u2013 including for the application of existing cross-cutting or emerging technologies, advanced manufacturing, ICT, eco-innovative and resource-efficient solutions, new business models, service innovation and design. The potential of clusters \u2013 that represent favourable ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship \u2013 need to be better exploited in this respect.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship across different regions and value chains shall be promoted. The coordination and facilitation shall be led by cluster organisations and other intermediary organisations, by following a systemic approach that combines different resources, tools and instruments. Innovation actors, especially SMEs with mutually reinforcing competences, shall be supported in view of creating new industrial value chains that foster the development of emerging industries in Europe.</p><p>To this end, proposals shall outline a strategic vision for building new industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries. They shall specifically focus on integrating and supporting groups of SMEs in collaboration with other innovation actors in addressing specific problems and challenges. Cluster organisations or other SME intermediaries shall be invited to set up collaboration and networking activities for SMEs and create a favourable \"open space\" for cross-sectoral fertilisation and value chain innovation to take place. Each proposal should demonstrate the capacity to:</p><p>1) validate ideas for structured innovation projects driven by SMEs from different sectors and countries in collaboration with other innovation actors and facilitate the coordination towards new industrial value chains through this collaboration space.</p><p>2) support innovation activities and/or channel a mix of different targeted entrepreneurial and innovation support measures (such as mentoring, coaching, innovation and technical assistance vouchers, etc.) directly to the innovation actors of the validated innovation projects to further support their development, integration and large-scale demonstration in a strategic manner. At least 75% of the total proposed budget shall be allocated to support innovation in SMEs directly, whereby the SMEs benefit by either participating in the consortium or by being supported as third party enterprises.</p><p>Background information on the systemic approach and strategic focus to be envisaged is provided to applicants.<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> Synergies with the European Structural and Investment Funds that may further support such large-scale demonstration projects will also be actively encouraged, notably through the engaged SME intermediaries. \u201cLarge-scale\u201d does not necessarily refer to the amount of financial support provided for a particular project but to the extent of the roll-out of a staged process of experimentation and implementation with accompanying support that reaches out to groups of mutually reinforcing SMEs. This approach aims at \u201cdemonstrating at large scale\u201d the potential impact of innovative solutions to specific challenges, rather than supporting isolated projects or SMEs.</p><p>For the first stage of the submission procedure, applicants should provide a concept note (of max. 10 pages), which should include a clear description of the ideas and objectives for an innovation action towards the development of new industrial value chains as well as an explanation of the main activities, implementation modalities (including for financial support to third parties, if applicable) and expected results foreseen. The concept note should further describe how the proposed systemic approach and strategic focus promises significant impact on economic growth and job; demonstrates a European dimension and added value; and has the potential to act as a catalyst by contributing to and/or leveraging other activities supported, for instance, under the European Structural and Investment Funds, e.g. in the context of smart specialisation strategies.</p><p>An estimate of the total costs of the proposed action and contribution to be requested from the Commission shall also be provided. Only proposals that pass the evaluation threshold for the first stage will be invited to a second stage of submission for a full proposal with a detailed description of the budget and activities planned to be undertaken.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposal requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 2.5 and 5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p>This action allows for the provisions of financial support to third parties in line with the conditions set out in part K of the General Annexes.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\">  <li>Strengthen industrial leadership in the EU Member States and Associated Countries by reinforcing value chains that integrate innovative solutions in SMEs, along and across existing value chains. </li>  <li>Stimulate the creation of new globally competitive industrial value chains across the EU Member States and Associated Countries to accelerate the development of emerging industries, which will boost industrial competitiveness and underpin future economic growth, jobs, and progress towards a resource-efficient economy. </li>  <li>Further leverage and complement support for innovation in SMEs and other funding, which may be provided by national or regional authorities (including under the European Structural and Investment Funds) and/or by private investors (upfront or as follow-up investments), including in relation to the European Fund for Strategic Investments, Knowledge and Innovation Communities, European Technology Platforms, European Innovation Partnerships etc. </li>  <li>Contribute to regional smart specialisation strategies by capitalising upon concentrated and complementary competences for the development of new industrial value chains and emerging industries with a clear EU added-value. </li>  <li>Provide a clear and measurable contribution to the innovation performance of the supported SMEs in the short-term \u2013 as revealed by indicators such as numbers of new or significantly improved products (goods and/or services), processes, new marketing methods, or new organisational methods \u2013, and to its impact on resource efficiency and/or turnover. A wider impact is also expected in the medium-term. </li>  <li>Improve the business environment of the supported SMEs by establishing open collaboration spaces that can involve innovation actors from different sectors and countries. This will lead to the creation of new ideas for innovation and new collaboration partnerships, which will be subject of further development and with the potential for further impact on business turnover.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Information (e.g. results from ongoing studies and expert analyses) is available at the EU Cluster Portal at <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cluster/\">http://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cluster/</a>and a background note has been made available at the topic related pages under Conditions &amp; Documents at the Participant Portal at <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/304-innosup-1-2015.html\">http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/304-innosup-1-2015.html</a></p>", "conditions": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-sme_en.pdf\">H2020 Work Programme 2016-17: Dissemination, Exploitation and Evaluation</a>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016-2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    Note also that a number of non-EU/non-Associated Countries that are not automatically eligible for funding have made specific provisions for making funding available for their participants in Horizon 2020 projects (follow the links to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_china_en.pdf\">China</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_japan_en.pdf\">Japan</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_korea_en.pdf\">Republic of Korea</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_mexico_en.pdf\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_russia_en.pdf\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020_localsupp_taiwan_en.pdf\">Taiwan</a>). <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/wp/2016_2017/annexes/h2020-wp1617-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 51, 102);\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></strong> Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.

A strong rationale exists for public support to SMEs\u2019 innovation activities in order to overcome market failures specific to SMEs and to fully realise their growth potential. The public supports \u2018SME innovation\u2019 with grants, subsidised loans, equity and a wide range of innovation support services. However, SMEs receiving innovation support often remain dissatisfied with the services they receive; while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided. The nature of innovation is changing: open data, open software, open hardware design and crowd-funding make it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources \u2013 but the challenge arises from scaling these initial offerings to create growth and jobs. Social innovation is required at the interface between public services and private enterprise to maintain the high standard and security of living in Europe. While small enterprises face challenges in recruiting talent - among others as a result of increased mobility \u2013 researchers have problems pursuing academic careers and work below their qualifications.</p><p>As the nature and environment for innovation changes the public innovation support has not only to follow those developments but also become proactive in shaping them.</p><p>The following call for proposal is one element of a broader action to develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Where appropriate, a highly specialised support service may be established at European level to complement existing national and regional services. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, peer-learning and uptake of new approaches. In the work programme 2016-17 emphasis is put on testing three new approaches to a better innovation support in large pilot actions that should deliver results in time for the start of discussion on the next framework programme for research and innovation. The Enterprise Europe Network, present in all European regions and co-financed by them, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to play an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 5, 2017 11:00:57 AM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (4th April 2017- 17:00:00), a total of 73 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:31:16 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2016-2017(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2016 12:30:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-03-2017(CSA), INNOSUP-07-2017(RIA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 1, 2016 8:38:54 AM", "content": "<p>H2020-INNOSUP-02-2016 SME Innovation Associate - at the closing&nbsp;date (30&nbsp;June 2016 17:00:00 BLT), a total of 192 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 13, 2016 12:00:29 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-01-2016-2017 - at the closing of stage 1 (6 April 2016 17:00:00), a total of 97 proposals were submitted in response to this call.</p>\r\n<p>INNOSUP-02-2016- SME Innovation Associate: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate-essential-tips-your-application\">essential tips to applicants </a>were published.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2016 9:51:12 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-02-2016(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 28, 2016 5:36:08 PM", "content": "<p>INNOSUP-02-2016: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/sites/easme-site/files/h2020-sme-_innovation-associate-presentation.pdf\">Additional Information for Applicants </a>are published on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/easme/en/h2020-sme-innovation-associate\">H2020 SME Innovation Associate webpage </a><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 8, 2015 12:30:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-04-2016(CSA-CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 10, 2015 12:30:02 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-05-2016-2017(CSA-CSA-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
