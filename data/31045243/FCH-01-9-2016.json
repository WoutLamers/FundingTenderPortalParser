Five bus OEM\u2019s are developing next generation bus models to show the cost down potential and take the technology from a current TRL 6/7 (demos) to TRL 8/9 (semi and full commercialisation) level from now through the end of Horizon 2020.</p><p>The purpose of this bus validation topic is therefore to establish a committed coalition that can achieve the aggregate volume and a demonstration scale that is necessary to meet further cost reductions required for a full commercialisation of fuel cell bus technology and the associated infrastructure by 2020. FC bus manufacturers have indicated that a cumulative production volume of 500 to 1000 buses is required to trigger full commercial roll-out. This is a challenge both in terms of acquisition of the buses (large enough numbers to reduce costs) and their operation, and also the HRSs needed for such yield of hydrogen and its supply.</p><p><em>*See: Well-To-Wheels Report Version 4.a JEC Well-To-Wheels Analysis: Well-To-Wheels Analysis of Future Automotive Fuels and Powertrains in the European Context</em></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic calls for simultaneous deployment and demonstration of larger scale FC bus fleets in line with the recommendations of the FCH JU\u2019s bus commercialisation roadmap in Europe until 2020*. The project will cover the roll-out of a set of fleets amounting to at least 100 FC buses consisting of at least 3 locations with minimum 20 buses per depot. The minimum number of buses per location/depot for additional locations should be 10. Concrete statements should be provided in the proposals regarding the willingness of operators to further expand the fleets after the project. The project will serve to analyse the operation of large fleets of buses and their impact on everyday heavy usage bus operation, including the specific purchasing mechanisms like e.g. joint procurement to efficiently commercialise innovative technology.</p><p><u>FC buses</u></p><p>The buses deployed within the project should have a high level of standardization and learning from previous projects shall reflect significantly in the availability of the buses. The buses are considered to be close to commercial readiness from both a technical maturity and an economic perspective.</p><p>The generation of FC buses deployed in this project shall at least have been tested in prior projects (EU &amp; non-EU, minor system changes to improve availability are acceptable) in order to assure a reliable operation of the bus fleets leveraging existing experience and leading to more operating uptime.</p><p>Buses are expected to comply with the following requirements:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Buses can be FC-hybrid or full power FC (FC system as the dominating power source), but at least half of the energy required for performing their expected duty cycle should be provided from hydrogen.</li>  <li>The minimum operational period for any bus demonstrated in the project is 24 months, whereas in all cases arrangements for extending operation after the end of the project are expected and should be documented in the proposal as a matter of key importance.

The envisaged cost level for a standard 12m FC-bus (equipped with a full power FC-system) produced in larger numbers in 2020 is 600,000 Euro*. Further, the project needs to trigger uptake of FC-buses by European cities. In addition it is anticipated that larger fleets of buses create higher public awareness of the technology increasing interest in hydrogen and fuel cell solutions for public transport in general, stimulating further demand.</p><p><u>HRS</u></p><p>Hydrogen refuelling stations for larger fleets of fuel cell buses will be heavily utilised and therefore generate a bigger learning effect in comparison to underutilised stations for other applications. It shall increase the confidence of bus operators in reliable fuel supply and demonstrate the viability of fuel cells in public transport even in a full role out scenario, i.e. all buses at a depot run on hydrogen. Furthermore, fuel cell bus stations can occasionally be combined with refuelling points for other applications that might trigger awareness, understanding and demand for applications. Previous engineering research will contribute to successful implementation and execution of this project.</p><p><u>Overall </u></p><p>The project should deliver:</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Lessons learnt from implementing and operating large hydrogen bus fleets for follower cities</li>  <li>Identification of bottlenecks \u2013 technical, organisational, structural, financial including RCS and formulation of recommendations on how to address these</li>  <li>Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the impact of the technology on public health and urban living (e.g. comparison against incumbent technology, in situ measurement etc.)</li> </ul><p>Professional dissemination of the activities of the project to the broad public is seen as a key part of the demonstration project. It should especially be foreseen to communicate the benefits of hydrogen and fuel cells in public transport.
