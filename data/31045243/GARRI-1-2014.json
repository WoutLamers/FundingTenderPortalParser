It has also the potential to draw better lessons from early warnings with a view to more efficient precautionary approaches. However, the current research and innovation system do not routinely take into account RRI requirements. Systemic barriers to the uptake of RRI approaches include lack of recognition in the career system of academic research for RRI/trans-disciplinary approaches, in evaluation criteria and by scientific journals, a lack of market incentives to internalise external costs of innovation (environmental, social, etc.) an insufficient training of researchers, institutional barriers, etc.[1] It is key to develop concrete policy actions to overcome these barriers and to foster systemic change, e.g. towards better societal engagement in knowledge-production and innovation.</p><p><u>Scope:</u> The action addresses systemic barriers to the implementation of Responsible Research and Innovation in research and innovation practices. The proposals shall aim to set the ground for concrete progress in relation to one of the various barriers (e.g. develop roadmaps, policy agendas, networks, coordination etc. during the lifetime of the project), identifying ways for better professional recognition and uptake of RRI approaches. Action for concrete progress could also focus on how to use existing instruments in different ways to implement systemic change: for example stimulating RRI implementation via using public procurement to start pre-commercial projects and to purchase innovative and sustainable products and services.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><u>Expected Impact</u>: The action will lower the barriers to the implementation of RRI approaches. It will lead to structural change in current research and innovation policies and systems, which will expand and consolidate the use of RRI methods and standards. Activities will signpost EU research teams seminal work in this domain; they will ensure complementary action at Member States level, and set best case examples and implementation standards for the industry. In the medium term, they will foster the capacity of research and innovation to tackle societal challenges in close cooperation with societal stakeholders, addressing the risks and benefits and the respect of fundamental values. </p><p><u>Type of action</u>: Research and Innovation Actions.</p><p>[1] See e.g. Expert Group on the State of Art in Europe on Responsible Research and Innovation (2013) \u2018Options for Strengthening Responsible Research and Innovation\u2019, http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/options-for-strengthening_en.pdf</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=31045243;crossCuttingPriorityCode=Gender;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Gender</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p>Please read carefully all provisions below before the preparation of your application.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">List of countries and applicable rules for funding: </span></strong>described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-a-countries-rules_en.pdf\">part A of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></strong> described in <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-b-adm_en.pdf\">part B</a> and <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-c-elig_en.pdf\">C of the General Annexes</a> of the General Work Programme, with the following exceptions: The specific eligibility conditions are the following: The consortium shall comprise at least one of each of the following types of partners: research performing or funding organisations, industry / businesses, policy makers, Civil Society Organisations.&nbsp;<br />\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">Evaluation </span></strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0,51,102)\">3.1&nbsp;
