Co-operation with third countries on interoperability of e-infrastructures for networking, computing and data in order to support joint-efforts on one or more major societal challenges (e.g.: health, agriculture, education/skills, etc.).

The activities should include the collection and aggregation of relevant policy information with impact on the development of EC-funded e-infrastructures, including KPIs and cost-related information, in coordination with the funded e-infrastructure initiatives and made available in open formats for reuse.

Support to dissemination for the e-infrastructure programme: </strong></em>Develop and maintain dissemination and collaboration activities for information sharing among projects and stakeholders. They should include a web-portal to convey updated information related to the evolution of e-infrastructures at regional, national and European levels, with a special focus on e-infrastructure projects funded under Horizon 2020. The portal will be a vehicle to present to experts and the wider public the catalogue of services offered by e-infrastructures as well as service-related KPIs and costs (see point above). It should support monitoring activities on take-up of open science and e-infrastructures policies (e.g. Horizon 2020 Open Research Data Pilot by research communities and citizens, per country, region and research domain).</p><p><em>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 1 and 1.5 million would allow this activity to be addressed appropriately.

It will help the identification of benefits of joint technology development, standardisation and sharing risks.</p><p><em><strong>(b) Coordination and Support Actions for International Co-operation and Policy Development:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>International Co-operation on e-infrastructure</strong> <strong>supporting major societal challenges: </strong></em>will exploit the potential for further economic and educational co-operation between Europe and third countries. It will also improve the identification of areas for further co-operation on scientific development and innovation. The actions will provide mechanisms to assess measurable benefits of co-operation on major societal challenges in the developing countries.</p><p><strong><em>Policy support to e-infrastructure programme:</em> </strong>Support actions provide solid ground for future choices for a comprehensive European Research Infrastructure and especially e-infrastructure policy and enable decision making and deployment of e-infrastructures. Successful collaboration between all projects under the H2020 e-infrastructure funding brings together all key stakeholders, and enables finding further synergies towards a harmonised European e-infrastructure approach.</p><p><strong><em>Support to dissemination for the e-infrastructure programme:</em></strong> improve awareness and knowledge about priorities of e-Infrastructures activities and strategies increasing the transparency and accountability of the workprogramme implementation.</p><p><strong><em>Support to small-size foresight roadmaps for the e-infrastructure
