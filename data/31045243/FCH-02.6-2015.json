In order to achieve cost levels allowing for mass deployment, stationary fuel cells need further significant cost reductions in their manufacturing. The currently still low production volumes do not allow identifying, improving and validating all factors that influence the robustness and yield of the manufacturing processes on cell, stack and system level. To reduce costs and increase quality cost effective manufacturing technologies are required for the medium term. This topic focuses on actions to improve production processes and scaled production for stacks, and stack components (cell &amp; cassettes), key components like BOP components, system integration, inverter, heat exchanger etc., and whole systems. The aim is to develop/apply novel manufacturing technologies, including for example: laser welding, coating, 3D printing, molding and casting of materials that are used for fuel cell system components and /or fuel cell stacks.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Projects should support development and use best in class manufacturing technologies, production processes, equipment and tooling with cost impact on, for example, stacks, reformers, pre-heaters, BOP and heat exchangers. Optimised production processes for mass manufacturing can include automated assembly, shortened cycle times, continuous production and lean manufacturing with little waste and should be compatible with environmental and health standards. Thus development and adaption of production processes with fewer steps, more tolerant to varying quality of raw materials and with lower-cost materials or materials with reduced environmental or health impacts are important tasks as well as advanced quality control methods.</p><p>Innovative manufacturing technologies could also be considered to provide complex design solutions with increased performance while allowing for lower cost levels compared to conventional production technologies.</p><p>Pilot plants are excluded.</p><p>To achieve cost reduction projects may also aim to develop industry-wide agreements for standard BoP components for FCs, including heat exchangers, reformers, converters, inverters, post-combustors, actuators and sensors. Reaching this target it\u2019s necessary to establish a resilient supply chain with respect of REACH Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p.1) and other regulations impacting on manufacturing.</p><ul level=\"0\">  <li>Residential (0.3 \u2013 5 kW): start TRL 5, end TRL 8</li>  <li>Commercial (5 \u2013 400 kW): start TRL 4, end TRL 6</li>  <li>Industrial (0.4 \u2013 10 MW): start TRL 4, end TRL 6</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Projects will enable important players in the fuel cell system segment to implement technologies enabling the step-up from small scale production towards higher volumes. Increased manufacturing capacity by elimination of slow processes and automation of highly manual intensive processing steps will lead to lower manufacturing costs which are the most critical factor towards real market competiveness.
