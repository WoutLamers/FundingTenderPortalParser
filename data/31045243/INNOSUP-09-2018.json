The report shows the difficulty of the decision making for investors when confronted to high growth potential innovative companies, especially those led by disruptive market-creating innovation. Indeed, enhanced technology and market expertise is needed but not always available to assess the technological viability of projects. Complex technology and \"asymmetric knowledge\" between the companies and lenders/investors worsen the general risk aversion of the latters. Indeed as shown by Nobel Price Akerloff, asymmetries leading to a single price equilibrium mixing different qualities dynamically converge to a market collapse. The transaction cost related to the technological assessment is relatively higher for smaller funding needs. As a consequence Innovative SMEs, and in particular those providing/driving breakthrough/disruptive market-creating innovation, struggle to access to finance.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>A core solution to improve access to risk finance for innovative enterprises should target these informational asymmetries at their source to help investors decision making by signalling positively technologically rigorous and promising projects, and avoiding a mixed equilibrium between non-viable and viable projects leading to higher interest rate and to the migration of very promising projects outside the EU. Hence, such a solution would lower the risk premium as well as the administrative cost for technological assessment that are ultimately paid by innovative project managers, and therefore should reduce the cost of financing for innovative project managers. Such tool could help improving EU Access to Finance conditions for innovators by better selecting projects, making a better allocation of resources, and a better use of EU private existing fundings by channelling them to companies in position to succeed in their projects, therefore participating to the creation of growth and jobs. Such tool could also help improving the reputation of investing in EU and AC innovative companies by increasing the success probability of such investments which could ultimately lead to attract new investors in the field.</p><p>The action will therefore consist of:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The design and development of (a) methodolog(y)(ies) and relating tool(s) providing (a) technological assessment(s) / rating(s) of technologies (being) developed / carried out by EU and AC <sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> innovative SMEs seeking for investments for their growth, the methodology should account of the diversity of the strengthes and weaknesses of EU and AC SMEs (supply chain, collaterals, IP, sectorial positioning...); </li><li>The testing of the above-mentioned technological assessment / rating methodolog(y)(ies) and relating tools with different group of investors (e.g. business angels, VC, banks (including promotional banks); \u2026). The testing must also target different type of EU and AC innovative SMEs;</li><li>The development of a deployment plan of the above-mentioned methodolog(y)(ies) / tool(s). </li> </ul><p>The action, of an expected length of 3 years, could involve, if relevant, participants from third countries.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 3 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Technological advances are making it easier and cheaper to start enterprises with limited own resources - but SMEs often struggle to scale up and create new jobs, including recruiting talent.</p><p>There is a wide range of public sector support through grants, subsidised loans, equity, and innovation support services. Yet SMEs are often dissatisfied with these, while at the same time the public expects a higher return from the support provided.</p><p>The following call for proposals is one element of a broader action to address these challenges and develop the ecosystem of innovation support to SMEs in Europe. Generally, the actions are designed to provide opportunities to Member States and regions to enhance their services through collaboration, and peer-learning. The emphasis is on further testing new approaches for better innovation support, such as blockchain technologies, workplace innovation, a network for Open Innovation, training on advanced manufacturing, experimentation in innovation agencies and a tool for investors in financing SMEs. These large pilot actions will consolidate the results and provide recommendations for the preparation of the next framework programme. The Enterprise Europe Network, the National Contact Points (NCPs) and the Member States are expected to continue playing an important role in implementing these pilot actions and transferring the result 'in-real-time' to their regions and managing authorities of their European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds).</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Nov 19, 2020 3:49:01 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 19, 2020 3:49:01 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2020(CSA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Aug 4, 2020 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 4, 2020 12:00:00 AM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-08-2020(CSA)</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 18, 2020 1:37:26 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 18, 2020 1:37:26 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: INNOSUP-01-2018-2020(IA)"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 17, 2020 3:00:51 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 17, 2020 3:00:51 PM", "content": "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"margin: 0px;
