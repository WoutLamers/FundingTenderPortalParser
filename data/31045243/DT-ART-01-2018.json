For systems with high levels of automation, the need for testing and validation will drastically increase as a comprehensive range of driving situations and scenarios have to be considered. Current available procedures do not provide an efficient and cost-effective solution. There is a great need for a comprehensive approach to develop common procedures for testing, validation and certification for highly automated driving functions in various traffic scenarios. </p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Research should focus on the development of testing and validation procedures of highly automated driving functions for different use cases in various traffic scenarios, including cross-border travelling. Proposed solutions shall seek broad consensus and agreement among involved stakeholders across the value chain. Therefore, a large participation of stakeholders from industry and Member States is crucial. Data and knowledge gathered from on-going and future pilot tests across Europe should provide a sound scientific basis to define comprehensive validation procedures for highly automated driving. Data obtained by proposed actions should be made available for all manufacturers and stakeholders. Procedures for merging the real-time simulation of driving environments with real tests on complete vehicle or on one or several subsystems in parallel should be researched to reduce testing time and costs, foster the collaboration between different stakeholders and analyse complex interactions in complete sets of tests. Proposals should elaborate common criteria for model-based validation and simulation on vehicle level as well as on vehicle components, and V2X communication systems level. The consideration of new testing procedures and tools for reliable and accurate positioning as well as for cyber-security vulnerability assessment would be an asset.</p><p>Proposed actions should build on the knowledge and results of on-going projects and other initiatives addressing testing and validation procedures of highly automated driving functions as well as fully leveraging the potential of advanced services offered by EGNOS and Galileo. It will be necessary to catalogue and analyse existing procedures and parameters and to identify gaps and weaknesses and potential synergies. Proposals should look at the possibility of employing new approaches to testing and validation, for example procedures already used successfully in other sectors which could be transferred and adopted to highly automated driving functions. The development of testing and validation procedures should also take into account the needs of type approval.</p><p>In line with the Union's strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. In particular, proposals should consider cooperation with projects or partners from the US, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and/or Australia. Proposals should foresee twinning with entities participating in projects funded by US DOT <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> to exchange knowledge and experience and exploit synergies.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU between EUR 4 to 6 million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately.

Many demonstration projects are already ongoing where automated driving functions are tested in different use cases. The previous call on \"Automated Road Transport\" in the Transport Workprogramme 2016/17 focused on vehicles with functions for automated driving level 3, which are expected to enter the market in the next few years.</p><p>The overall objective of this call is to promote a wide market introduction of highly automated driving systems towards SAE level 4[[Definition of SAE Level 4 \u2013 High Automation: \"the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene\".]]. The call will focus on large-scale demonstrations to test the performance and safety of innovative highly automated driving systems for passenger cars, efficient freight transport operations and shared mobility services in urban areas. Furthermore the changing role of the driver and how to account for it by human centred design of automated vehicles will be addressed.</p><p>The Call 2018-2020 Automated Road Transport is part of the Focus Area \"Digitising and transforming European industry and services\". Demonstrations will look at testing the use of digital, connectivity as well as satellite navigation technologies for optimised connected and automated driving functions (including the EGNOS and Galileo). Digital technologies, such as Big Data, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence techniques provide a great potential for developing innovative automated driving functions and mobility solutions for the future. Communication and cooperation of automated vehicles with other vehicles, infrastructure and other road users can increase the safety, comfort, productivity and the enabling of innovative business models of automated vehicles and improve the efficiency of the overall transport system.</p><p><em>By supporting innovative connected and automated driving technologies and mobility solutions, the call will help to create new global market opportunities for European industry and strengthen the position of Europe as a world leader in innovative mobility. Actions under this call are expected to contribute to more road safety as well as to better traffic flow, less congestion, fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. New shared and fully automated mobility services can help decrease the total number of cars on the road, alleviating the overall traffic. Actions will contribute to UN's Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable) and 3.6 (By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents).</em></p><p>In addition to the topics of this call, actions related to \"Automated Road Transport\" are included in the \"Mobility for Growth\" call of this part of the Work Programme as well as in other parts of the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018-2020. The call \"Mobility for Growth\" includes topics on \"Human Factors in Transport Safety\" (MG-2.1-2018), \"Safety in an evolving road and mobility environment\" (MG-2.4-2019), \"New regulatory frameworks to enable effective deployment of emerging technologies and business models\" (MG-4.2-2018) and \"Driver behaviour and acceptance of connected, cooperative and automated transport\" (MG-3.4-2019), which refer to connected and automated systems and technologies of all transport modes. Cooperation and cross-fertilisation of concepts and technologies across transport modes developed in the different proposals is strongly encouraged.
