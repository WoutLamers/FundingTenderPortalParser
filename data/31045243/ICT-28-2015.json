However, while Europe has excellent R&D results in individual KETs, it often fails to turn those timely into highly innovative products. In particular, Europe fails to bring stakeholders from the different KETs together around new value chains and new business collaborations. These will create value above and beyond the mere addition of individual technologies and are essential for Europe to develop multi-disciplinary technological capabilities and bring into the market new, high value-added products that are manufactured in Europe. By investing more on innovation and in particular on KET deployment projects and integration platforms as well as on KET pilot lines, in particular around micro-nano-electronics, photonics and manufacturing, there will be a direct impact on Europe's global competitiveness \u2013 in particular for the SMEs \u2013 as well as on Europe's capability to offer new solutions for some of the major societal challenges it faces.</p><p><u>Scope</u>:</p><p><strong>a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong><strong>Innovation Actions</strong></p><p><b>ICT-KET integrated platforms for the healthcare and food sectors</b><i>: </i>Further development and validation in real settings of reliable, low-cost micro-nano-bio and bio-photonics systems driven by users.
