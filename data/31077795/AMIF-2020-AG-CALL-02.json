In this emergency context, the integration measures in most Member States focused on ensuring that basic needs would be met in an unfamiliar country, with an emphasis on language learning and access to employment. Few Member States developed integration measures covering the full social and economic inclusion of all their residents</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup></span>. <span>In this regard, there is still a need to facilitate and provide access to basic services for TCNs, in order to encourage further integration and inclusion. These services should ideally be offered in a \u201cmainstreaming approach\u201d so that migrants can fully access the benefits provided by other social policies, which they would be entitled to.</span></p><p><span>The inability to communicate effectively in a host country\u2019s </span><span>language can impede access to services and achieving long-term integration. National government authorities are aware of the importance of supporting language learning, but in many countries there is a clear drop-off in support for intermediate and advanced courses. It is therefore crucial to provide adequate language learning possibilities at various levels for TCNs in order to facilitate their integration into all aspects of society, local labour markets and education systems.</span></p><p><span>Although language learning for primary and secondary school children is usually provided by their host country in order to permit children to integrate into the school system, further language training for young adults is often not provided. Language courses at various levels, including intermediate (B1-B2) and advanced (C1-C2) levels according to the Common European Framework for Languages</span>[[<span></span><span><a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions\">https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions</a></span><span><span></span>, would be necessary in order to allow adult TCNs, who have not been through the local school system, to access vocational and higher education programmes.<span> </span></span></p><p><span>While TCNs generally have access to mainstream public employment</span><strong><span style=\"color:#1E235C;\"> </span></strong><span>services, availability of other services or vocational training opportunities that are tailored specifically to the needs of TCNs are not always ensured throughout the EU. </span><span>Moreover, it would be useful to promote financial inclusion and literacy of TCNs in order to facilitate their access to financial services, including digital banking, mortgages, loans and investments. </span><span>Access to health care and housing also requires more attention from policy-makers. To counter the lack of social housing in some countries, specific initiatives should be put into place in order to assist TCNs in finding proper and affordable accommodation. </span></p><p><span>The global COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable communities, including TCNs across the EU</span>[[<span><span>Analysis on Covid-19\u2019s impact of migrant communities published in EWSI (</span></span><span><span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/covid-19s-impact-on-migrant-communities\">https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/news/covid-19s-impact-on-migrant-communities</a></span></span><span><span>).</span><span></span>. Health care systems have been overstretched and in many cases, TCNs did not receive proper support nor relevant information in their native language.</span></p><p><span>Intercultural competence in health care systems is increasingly recognised as an </span><span><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/librarydoc/report-on-the-health-of-refugees-and-migrants-in-the-who-european-region\"><span style=\"color:black\">essential element of adequate health care provision</span></a></span><span>. In a majority of countries, it is possible for TCNs to obtain interpretation or cultural mediation services (including via telephone or video), but only a handful of countries make these types of services widely available.</span></p><p><span>Finally, interpreting services should be of high professional level (both linguistically and ethically) in order to provide sufficient support to TCNs in accessing health care, housing and social service sectors. Currently, interpreters and cultural mediators are not always trained by institutions specialised in interpreting training, providing internationally accepted qualification recognised by professional organisations. Sometimes interpreters do not have any training at all, are trained on the spot or follow short courses organised by NGOs. This results in an unequal quality of interpreting, which can be harmful to both the beneficiary and the provider of the public service involved. Therefore, there is a need to provide systematic and professional training to public service interpreters provided by recognised institutions, based on a framework of minimum standards.</span></p><p><strong><span>Objectives</span></strong></p><p><span>The objective of this topic is to improve access to basic services for TCNs, by identifying and reducing obstacles to access services in one or several of the following areas: </span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Health care, including mental health, psychological support, COVID-19 related information and support,</span></li><li><span>Labour market, especially access to public employment services and to vocational training,</span></li><li><span>Social security benefits,</span></li><li><span>Housing,</span></li><li><span>Financial literacy and access to financial services,</span></li><li><span>Continuous education from primary to tertiary levels.</span></li> </ul><p><span>In particular the aim is to improve the quality and availability of information on accessing these services, the capacity of service providers to deal with TCNs, addressing language, cultural and other possible barriers in accessing these services.
