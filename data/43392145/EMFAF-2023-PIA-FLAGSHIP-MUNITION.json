This work will facilitate the exchange of best practices across different stakeholders and sea-basins and contribute to awareness raising.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic focuses on:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Gathering and analysing existing, available data from all relevant sources and databases on submerged munitions<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> including identification of gaps in the data. This should cover, for example, data on possible impacts on nature and the environment, maritime activities and the public to inform the establishment of priorities in tackling submerged munitions and for the conduct of risk assessments.</li><li>Filling gaps, including by deploying systems at sea to collect and gather additional data that are needed for the establishment of priorities, including the use of cutting-edge technologies.</li><li>Identifying and proposing a list of relevant factors for the establishment of priority sites where submerged munitions should be addressed (e.g., the state of corrosion of the munitions, the intention to install new wind farms, the risks linked to the marine environment).</li><li>Encouraging data sharing and best practice sharing among relevant entities in the Baltic Sea region dealing with the issue of submerged munitions.</li><li>Awareness raising on the risks and impacts of submerged munitions dumped at sea</li> </ul><p>Proposals should cover all of the above themes.</p><p>Projects should carry out as many as possible of the following activities (NB: this list is non-exhaustive):</p><p>Gap analysis</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Identifying the relevant sources of data (e.g. maps and databases) on submerged munitions in the Baltic Sea to create an inventory of data sources and types.</li><li>Perform analysis of the main existing maps and

structured and stable coordination and collaboration on submerged munitions, e.g. through a framework/forum bringing together Member State authorities, public and private sector bodies, investors, and citizens.</li><li>A more coherent approach across the Baltic Sea to tackling submerged munitions.</li><li>An acceleration in the mitigation of dumped munitions in the Baltic Sea thanks to campaigns involving the public and private sectors, investors and citizens.</li><li>A high level of open and transparent information sharing across Member States on submerged munitions from civil and military sources, contributing to greater safety and more effective tackling of the issues.</li><li>Greater awareness and increased capacity of Member State authorities on the impacts of submerged munitions and how to measure and monitor these impacts.</li><li>Increased capacity in private entities to contribute to Baltic Sea Region collaboration and activities to mitigate underwater munitions.</li><li>Greater capacity in other sea basins to tackle submerged munitions building on knowledge, capacity and lessons learned in the Baltic Sea and allowing the replication of results in other sea basins, particularly in the Black Sea.</li> </ul>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>For example, including data from HELCOM and national military organisations.</p>", "conditions":

The position, quantity, and identity of such munitions, however, has been poorly documented. In addition, the positions of such munitions are not fixed. Some munitions are buried by silting or change position due to natural underwater movements (e.g., currents) or human activities (e.g., trawling or dredging), resulting in the spread of explosives and contaminants.</p><p>This situation raises environmental concerns as, with the passage of time, the corrosion of munition casings due to mechanical and chemical processes results in the release of chemicals contained in the munitions. Additionally, chemical munitions have remained on the seabed far longer than originally intended. The variations associated with different mechanical and chemical processes (such as water depth, temperature and the depth of buried objects) that contribute to the release of chemical agents from their casings, results in difficult and inexact modelling of risk of release into seawater.</p><p>Several studies point to the significant environmental damage that is expected to manifest itself over the next 5 to 10 years with long lasting consequences, due to chemical leakage of these munitions. The tipping point has already been reached, since many of the munitions, after nearly a century underwater, are already significantly corroded.</p><p>In addition to the evident environmental implications this may have, from a blue economy perspective, submerged munitions also impede the development and the construction of offshore renewable energy sites. While posing physical danger, for example to fishing vessels, such as trawlers and their crew, underwater munitions also pose significant danger of contamination, for example of aquaculture sites, due to the accidental release of chemicals. The increasing need for the use of the seafloor (e.g., for offshore wind farms, undersea cables, pipelines, fisheries trawling operations), heightens such risks, due to the increased probability of encountering sea-dumped munitions.</p><p>In January 2021, the European Commission launched an <a href=\"http://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/cd376452-c69c-11ec-b6f4-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-256653837\">external study</a>, under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, to gather knowledge on the mapping of underwater unexploded munitions, streamline best practices for accidental encounters with dumped munitions, and to address relevant environmental concerns. The study pointed out that the problem is particularly acute in the Baltic Sea, which was heavily mined during World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII). The Baltic Sea was also the dumping site for aborted and accomplished missions, after these Wars. In terms of number, while there are at least 1.6 million tonnes of munitions from the World Wars in the North and Baltic Sea, 300 000 tonnes of these are in the Baltic Sea alone. Submerged munitions are, therefore, drawing increasing public and political attention in this area.</p><p>Taking into account the extent and gravity of the problem, there is a need to establish priority geographical areas where appropriate action should be taken as soon as possible. These priority areas should be established according to various factors \u2013 to be determined by the project \u2013 including the state of corrosion of the munitions, leakage of chemical substances and risks posed to the environment, the risks posed to mariners, the intention for the future use of the seabed (e.g., installation of data cables or development of windfarms).</p><p>Proposals responding to this call are expected to address the issue, by identifying and filling the remaining gaps on knowledge and data, which are necessary for the establishment of priority geographical areas and for the conduct of appropriate risk assessments.</p>\n<p>We expect to fund one project within the project budget (maximum grant amount) of EUR 2 018 000.</p><p>This does not however preclude the submission/selection of proposals requesting lower amounts. The grant awarded may be lower than the amount requested.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:12:21 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 29, 2024 12:12:21 PM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">EVALUATION RESULTS</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">In accordance with the call conditions, the evaluation was made looking at the criteria 'Relevance', 'Quality' and 'Impact.'
