Therefore, there is a shared interest in developing innovative responses that can apply within a sea basin and/or across sea basins. This means that projects should bring together participants from different Member States, located in a sea basin, or from different sea basins. To meet these challenges Member States will have to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><em>Reflect and align their maritime spatial plans to the ambition of the European Green Deal </em>and the related initiatives in areas such as climate change mitigation and/or adaptation, biodiversity, food, mobility, energy transition, alongside established activities and interests. As a cross-cutting instrument with a legal basis in all these policy areas, MSP can act as a powerful enabler of the EU's \"Green Deal\". This means that it will be therefore necessary for Member States to reflect in their maritime spatial plans the ambition of the Green Deal\u2019s objectives, and energy and climate plans, alongside established activities and interests.</li><li><em>Cater for cumulative impacts of ocean stressors: promote the use of an ecosystem-based approach</em>, including Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), strengthen the process of the Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs), which are an integral part of MSP and promote environmental monitoring to collect data and asses impacts (e.g. on offshore renewable energies).</li><li><em>Reinforce the sea basin dimension of MSP: meeting the above-mentioned challenges</em>, and integrating the new EU initiatives, will require greater cooperation in planning activities in the different sea basins. A good example of this is the North Sea, where coastal Member States have set up structures to strengthen the coordination when deploying offshore wind energy14 . Moving from a project approach, MSP should become a subject of discussion among Member States in sea basin governance bodies.</li><li><em>Making MSP digital and pan-European</em>: The aim of this \"digitalisation\" is to harmonise data and to disseminate the contents of these plans through a common or shared digital platform \u2013 the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). This sharing of data will facilitate cross-border consultation and cooperation and allow for a greater participation of stakeholders in the establishment and implementation of maritime spatial plans</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals are expected to develop innovative responses to tackle the above mentioned specific challenges that EU Members States might encounter in the implementation and/or revision of their maritime spatial plans.</p><p>Hereunder is a list of priorities related to the aforementioned challenges:</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li><em>MSP as an enabler of the European Green Dea</em>l. <em>Developing strategies and approaches to review/revise maritime spatial plans to make them future proof, more integrated and more coherent, especially in a sea basin context.</em> Contributing to the development or review of the MSPs, taking into account circular blue economy and nature-food-energy nexus, coherently in a seabasin context. Climate proofing of MSP, including incorporating climate adaptation and mitigation actions and/or strategies.</li><li><em>Facilitate/enable the development of marine protected areas and economic sectors (e.g. tourism and maritime/underwater cultural heritage, offshore energy, fisheries, aquaculture) in the maritime domain</em>: ex-ante assessments (Strategic Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment) and environmental monitoring; multi-use in project design and licensing/permits; development of a regulatory framework for multi-use, including Land Sea Interactions (LSI); allocation of sufficient sea space, enabling synergies with other sectors / activities.</li><li><em>Applying an Ecosystems Based Approach (EBA) in MSP</em>: designing maritime spatial plans to integrate objectives and measures of other EU instruments (e.g. the Marine Strategy Framework Directive) with the aim to reduce collective and cumulative pressures and ensuring that marine ecosystems are in a healthy, productive and resilient condition.</li><li><em>Analysing how maritime spatial plans identified and addressed existing and potential tensions between different sectors.</em> For example analysing the socio[1]economic implications of the offshore energy development and marine protected areas on recreation and tourism activities, boating, indigenous life, aquaculture and on fishing. Developing strategies on how to address those interactions, social and economic implications, increase the social acceptance and ensure perceived fairness in the MSP process.</li> </ol><p>Applicants should identify one <u>among the above </u>priorities, or address a combination thereof, and build their proposal around it.</p><p>Priority will be given to proposals that build on the outcome of prior MSP related projects, relevant to the objectives of the call. In this context, proposals should describe how they build on, complement and differ from finalised or ongoing research and innovation projects, including from EU programmes, where relevant. In case a proposal includes activities in a particular sea basin in which a dedicated sea basin strategy or similar initiative exists, priority will be given to proposals that explain how they contribute to the objectives of the relevant sea basin strategy or initiative</p><p><strong>Activities that can be funded:</strong></p><p>Applicants should explain in their proposal how they will implement the activities below described, resulting in concrete and measurable results within the project's duration. Projects must undertake one or more of the following main activities as part of the project implementation:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in articles 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the MSP Directive, including the review and/or revisions of maritime spatial plans;</li><li>Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 10 of the MSP Directive (Data use and sharing);</li><li>Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 11 of the MSP Directive (Cooperation among Member States);</li><li>Specific activities aimed at implementing provisions set out in article 12 of the MSP Directive (Cooperation with third countries).</li> </ul><p>In addition, applicants should include in their project the following complementary activities/tasks to support the above core activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Establishment of a Steering Committee (SC) to ensure the overall strategic steering of the project. The SC should comprise relevant representatives of the Member States where the action takes place (such as MSP competent authorities), as well as the beneficiaries involved. The Commission and CINEA may participate in an observer capacity only.</li><li>Establishment of an Advisory Committee (AC) to provide expert advice on the project's activities. The AC should be composed of a maximum of five recognised experts in MSP or in relevant fields of activity. The Commission and CINEA may participate in an observer capacity only.</li><li>Working procedures defining how the project and the SC will operate (assigning clear roles and responsibilities, describing the decision-making process, frequency of meetings etc.);</li><li>An opening and closing conference.</li> </ul><p>Applicants are strongly encouraged to assign dedicated staff to the development and implementation of the proposed communication and dissemination activities. This should be appropriately reflected in the proposed budget.</p><p>The list of complementary activities is non-exhaustive. Applicants may propose additional activities, as long as the proposed complementary activity is justified and establishes a coherent link with the project objectives and the objectives of this call.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>Applicants have to list the main results expected from the project. The expected results to be achieved by the end of the project must be concrete, realistic and time bound and quantifiable, as far as possible.</p><p>In particular, proposals are expected to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Ensure that maritime plans are coherent and coordinated across the marine region concerned;</li><li>Create a repository of best practices and lessons learnt from the project and a list of achievements of the projects, including in coordination with the European MSP platform;</li><li>Produce two \"policy briefs\", one at mid-term and one at the end of the project, that summarise the main results of the project and their relevance for the implementation of the MSP Directive. These documents should include elements of \"policy feedback\", in particular suggestions for changes / improvements in the current EU policy instruments.</li> </ul><p>In addition, the proposals should identify specific expected impacts in relation to the targeted \"Priorities\".</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 12pt; line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\">Conditions<br />\r\n<br type=\"_moz\" />\r\n</span></b></p>\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"color:#404040;mso-themecolor:&#10;text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the call document</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\"> described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">2.

It represents an overarching governance framework for EU Members States, which were required to adopt maritime spatial plans by 31 March 2021 in all EU marine waters. Maritime spatial planning shall contribute to the achievement of good environmental status as envisaged by Directive 2008/56/EC.</p><p>Among the requirements, Member States are requested to cooperate with bordering countries to ensure coherent plans are set across the marine region concerned and where possible to cooperate with third-country authorities. Furthermore, they are encouraged to make use of existing instruments and tools to organise the use of the best available data, necessary for the setting up of the maritime spatial plans.</p><p>In August 2023 17 Member States have successfully adopted their Maritime Spatial Plans, 5 Member states did not adopt yet and 1 Member state failed to adopt the plan for their outermost region. Most of the Member States with Maritime Spatial Plans not adopted are in Mediterranean Sea-basin.</p><p>On 11 December 2019 the European Commission presented the European Green Deal. It provides a roadmap with actions to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy and stop climate change, revert biodiversity loss and cut pollution. It outlines investments needed and financing tools available.</p><p>Because of its spatial dimension, MSP can act as a powerful \"enabler\" of the European Green Deal. This is the case for several initiatives launched in the context of the European Green Deal, such as the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the Farm to Fork Strategy for sustainable food or the EU strategy on offshore renewable energy. In May 2021, the Commission adopted a Communication on a new approach for a sustainable blue economy. It is understood that MSP will be one of the components of this new approach.</p><p>With the new Biodiversity Strategy the EU aims at increasing the network of marine protected areas and other effective conservation measures to reach 30% protection of the marine space by 2030. It is further proposed that 10% of this network would be under strict protection, this for areas of high biodiversity value or potential. In 2022 the European Commission proposed a Nature Restoration law, that aims to restore 20% of ecosystems by 2030. This may have an impact on maritime spatial planning as new areas for conservation and restoration will have to be identified.</p><p>The European Green Deal and the Farm to Fork Strategy underline the potential of farmed seafood as a source of protein for food and feed. As part of the Farm to Fork strategy the Commission adopted revised guidelines for a more sustainable and competitive EU aquaculture for the period 2021 to 2030. Aquaculture also needs to have their presence in the Maritime Spatial Plans.</p><p>Regarding the EU strategy on offshore renewable energy, MSP has been explicitly identified as an essential and well-established tool to facilitate the development of offshore renewable energy in the EU in a sustainable way. Further decarbonisation of the energy system is essential to achieve the EU's climate objectives in 2030 and 2050.</p><p>We are only at the start of the development of offshore renewables in all EU sea basins. The allocation of maritime space for increasing marine renewable energy production and fostered regional co-operation between Member States is essential, and maritime spatial planning plays a key role in this regard. Besides the legal requirements laid down in the MSP Directive, it is therefore necessary for Member States to reflect in their maritime spatial plans the ambition of the European Green Deal\u2019s objectives and energy and climate plans, alongside established activities and interests,.</p><p>This is an ongoing process in several sea-basins. One of the examples in this regard is the cooperation in the North Sea basin, a particularly crowded sea. North Sea countries have announced combined targets for offshore wind of 120 GW by 2030 in the North Sea and at least 300 GW by 2050. This ambition is prompting them to reflect on the need for closer cooperation on how to tackle the energy-food-nature challenges in heavily used seas.</p><p>EMFAF support to Maritime Spatial Planning Projects continues to cover the needs of EU Member States in the implementation, monitoring and revision of their maritime spatial plans, as well as to support the cross-border cooperation and combined efforts of countries at sea-basin level to tackle the targets under the European Green Deal and the above described initiatives.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 28, 2024 4:57:27 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 28, 2024 4:57:27 PM", "content": "<p>Call EMFAF-2023-PIA-MSP closed on the 27th February 2024.</p>\r\n<div>Two proposals have been submitted.</div>\r\n<div>Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in May 2024.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 26, 2023 12:00:03 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 26, 2023 12:00:03 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: EMFAF-2023-PIA-MSP(EMFAF-PJG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
