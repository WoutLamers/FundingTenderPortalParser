Current operations require special provisions that severely limit the use of these assets, in particular in dense European airspace. To overcome these limitations, RPAS need to be able to integrate into non-segregated airspace, safely flying along with manned aircraft, interoperable with both military and civil Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, including interaction with Air Traffic Control (ATC) where required. This capability, often referred to as Air Traffic Insertion (ATI), is a key enabler to allow significant expansion of RPAS operations. It is particularly useful for large RPAS (MALE (Medium-Altitude Long-Endurance) and tactical categories) which have range and endurance performances allowing them to address a large scope of missions, including flight operations in civil airspace in Europe.</p><p>The absence of a pilot on board means that technological and procedural enablers have to be put in place to allow RPAS operating like any other airspace user. This capability, referred to as Detect And Avoid (DAA), ensures that the RPAS will be able to safely handle collision hazards with any other air vehicles in the sky. For that purpose, it relies on a combination of sensors for traffic detection, and algorithms for collision risk assessment and avoidance manoeuvre. It also provides the remote pilot with a required view of the traffic, Situation Awareness (SA), in order to keep the RPAS away from collision hazard by the appropriate separation minima (remain well clear).</p><p>European cooperation (particularly the MIDCAS (Mid Air Collision Avoidance System) project) has already addressed the definition of a DAA solution and the flight evaluation of a proof-of-concept demonstrator. Furthermore, the MIDCAS Standardisation Support Phase (MIDCAS SSP) is well into standardisation of DAA by working actively in the EUROCAE (EURopean Organisation for Civil Aviation Equipment) Working Group-105 development of required standards (OSED (Operational Services and Environment Definitions), MASPS (Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards) and MOPS (Minimum Operational Performance Standards)) for DAA. However major efforts remain to be made to reach higher maturity levels and to design an integrated and certifiable solution. The proposals will address the main remaining technical challenges (gaps) of DAA through two main streams of effort:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Qualify the overall performance of a DAA solution and its compliance with safety objectives, for operations in both A-C airspace classes (cooperative traffic) and D-G airspace classes (cooperative and non-cooperative traffic);</li><li>Increase the technological maturity level of non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar) up to TRL 6 through Size Weight &amp; Power (SWAP) optimization and improvement of data processing.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals shall address the development and validation of a 100% European DAA solution, which does not contain technology subject to control or restriction by a third country or by a third-country entity (in particular free of any control regime by third countries), able to operate worldwide, in all airspace classes, compliant with applicable regulation &amp; standards, adaptable to a variety of RPAS/drones platforms (MALE, fixed-wing tactical RPAS, vertical take-off and landing RPAS), leveraging on available European background. The proposals should also cover the activities needed to increase the maturity level of non-cooperative sensors (<em>i.e.</em> visible, infrared and radar) through SWAP optimisation and improved robustness of data processing.</p><p>The proposals will address two main applications:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) flight operations insertion of RPAS in controlled airspace (A to C) with an initial emphasis on MALE;</li><li>IFR flight operations in uncontrolled airspace classes (D to G) for application to large tactical RPAS.</li> </ul><p>With the above, the proposals shall provide operational capability supporting initial (IOC) integration of RPAS in the European (A-C) airspace using cooperative DAA, as well as taking necessary steps towards full integration in all airspace classes (A-G).<br>These activities will be fully aligned with the RPAS 1 and RPAS 2 steps of the EU RPAS roadmap as well as the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) European ATM master plan.</p><p>The proposals shall foresee a maximum reuse of building blocks and technologies already developed under European cooperation.</p><p>The proposals should also fully support the ongoing standardisation and regulatory work within EUROCAE WG-105, EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency), JARUS (Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems) and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), as well as SESAR2020 and other relevant European programs (including EDA (European Defence Agency)-coordination DAA programs MIDCAS and MIDCAS-SSP).</p><p>The proposals should not address the insertion of small drones in the so-called U-Space and the operations in Very-Low Level airspace (VLL) but should consider the interoperability with U-space.</p><p><strong>Targeted activities:</strong></p><p>The proposals shall cover the necessary activities for the design, and where required prototyping, testing and qualification, of a European DAA solution applicable to military RPAS and to various types of platforms (MALE, fixed-wing tactical and vertical take-off and landing RPAS).</p><p>The proposals shall cover at least the design activities (and possibly upstream and downstream activities) from the following overall programme of work:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Design improvements of the detect function: sensors miniaturization (SWAP), robustness of sensor processing and fusion algorithms, adaptation to European platforms and related concept of operations;</li><li>Design, prototyping and extensive testing of two DAA solutions:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>For operations in A-C airspace classes (cooperative);</li><li>For operations in D-G airspace classes (non-cooperative).</li>   </ul> </li><li>Design, testing and qualification (through extensive simulation) of a Collision Avoidance (CA) function according to European reference scenarios;</li><li>Formal validation of safety case through extensive qualifying simulation programme using reference scenarios, models and conditions provided by Eurocontrol or Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), completed by flight tests;</li><li>Design and testing of a Remain Well Clear (RWC) function;</li><li>Implementation and flight testing of a TRL 6/7 demonstrator.</li> </ul><p>The proposals shall cover a view of the complete programme of work up to the operational system with a detailed description of the remaining work to be performed.</p><p><strong>Main high-level requirements:</strong></p><p>The system shall fulfil the following general requirements:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support safe integration of RPAS into controlled and uncontrolled airspaces, by assuring SA, RWC and CA functionalities with the applicable target level of safety for both cooperative and non-cooperative traffic;</li><li>Enable RPAS operating IFR and Beyond Radio Line-of-Sight (BRLOS) with all capabilities needed for operation in all airspace classes;</li><li>Embed cooperative (<em>e.g.</em> ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance \u2013 Broadcast) receiver or Bearing-less Active Surveillance (BLAS)) and non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar);</li><li>Embed miniaturized non-cooperative sensors (visible, infrared and radar) allowing their integration in tactical RPAS.
