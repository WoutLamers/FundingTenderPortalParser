Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, cyber security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>Member States are increasingly pooling and sharing their defence efforts to increase their strategic autonomy in a geopolitical context, overcome new security risks with enhanced military capabilities, and create a more competitive and integrated defence industry.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite types and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security is the key feature belonging to all those requirements that in addition need to be met in the most efficient way.</p><p>However, these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber attacks against military satellite communication networks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to reply to this security challenge is the satellite communication waveform, which needs to be as protected and secure as possible.</p><p>Different initiatives to make satellite communications more secure and reliable through the creation of (proprietary) protected waveforms have already been undertaken and/or are ongoing within the military context. Yet the results of those initiatives are used only in sovereign national satellite networks of some major nations, driven and supported by big international industrial players.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, <em>etc.</em>) context.<br>The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multi-national development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The EPW shall be able to operate in this complex military operational environment and bring a solution to the challenges described.</p><p>Proposals should address feasibility, design and development of an EPW for satellite communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions) with five key considerations in mind.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>European autonomy and cooperation between Member States</li> </ul><p>The EPW shall be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technology for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it shall allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context in order to exchange mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Affordable and efficient satellite services</li> </ul><p>The EPW shall be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (Operational expenditure) (reduce bandwidth costs, need for less resources for planning) and CAPEX (Capital expenditure) (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems.</p><p>The EPW shall include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (<em>e.g. </em>DVB-S2X (Extension to Digital Video Broadcasting \u2013 Satellite Second generation standard) waveform standard) in combination with the latest security technology. There shall no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands shall be achieved even with small terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Flexibility and scalability</li> </ul><p>The EPW shall be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO (Low Earth Orbit), MEO (Medium Earth Orbit), GEO (Geostationary Equatorial Orbit), high-throughput systems, spot beams, regional and global beams) and different network architectures (VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal), SCPC (Single Channel Per Carrier), mesh). At the same time, the EPW shall be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications from low to very high data rates.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Innovation</li> </ul><p>The EPW development shall not just be a copy and paste of existing solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal shall be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW program shall be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Security and resilience</li> </ul><p>The main feature of the EPW shall be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development shall focus on building satellite links that are resistant to cyber attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric conditions or on-the-move communication challenges shall be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity shall investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different government and defence end-users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p><p><strong>Targeted activities:</strong></p><p>The proposals shall cover the initial phases of the development of the EPW including in particular:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Feasibility study, threat analysis, CONOPS definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition;</li><li>Detailed design of the system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and finishing with the Critical Design Review (CDR);</li><li>The development of small-scale technological demonstrators with military end-users in an operational environment, in order to support decision making during the design phase.</li> </ul><p>The end state shall be an EPW standard for satellite communication (comparable to other communication waveform standards) that can be implemented by nations or industry on their individual baseband solutions.</p><p><strong>Main high-level requirements:</strong></p><p>The EPW development shall fulfil requirements at the level of both the waveform and the satellite baseband equipment (terminals, modems, hubs, networks). The demarcation point is the edge router of the satellite network which connects the hubs, gateways and modems with outside networks or the internet.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Baseband equipment requirements:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>The right implementation of the terminal will determine the success of the EPW.
