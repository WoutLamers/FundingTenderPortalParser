Interoperability and cross-domain operations shall be part of the solution.</p><p>The proliferation of advanced long-range Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS), incorporating threats that can operate across different frequency bands and attack aircraft at ranges up to 400 km, could create Anti Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) areas. In such A2/AD areas, air power cannot operate or be projected in case of conflict. In particular, access to large swaths of territory over EU nation\u2019s airspace could be denied in case of a conflict. The only effective way for Europe to counteract these air defence means is to have a capability of Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA), able to create a safe bubble around the formation of aircrafts. </p><p>From the operational perspective, the AEA capability must find, locate and track Electro Magnetic (EM) threats and deliver high power jamming signals in the full Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum used in military operations. </p><p>Currently the EU capability in countering these threats is limited to few platforms and, when needed, most of the required capability is provided by NATO allies. The EU Capability Development Plan (CDP) also identifies electronic attack as one of the priority areas for development. </p><p>EU therefore needs to catch up with emerging Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies to enable aircrafts to operate into the danger zones created by advanced air defence systems, in order to operate its air power from within its own territories as well as in vital geographical areas.</p><p>The EU industries have traditionally been developing advanced capabilities in the field of EW, but not at the level required by an electronic attack system, limiting the strategic autonomy of Europe for this critical capability.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>This topic invites to launch the development a European electronic attack system that will remove the above-mentioned limitations. This capability will allow European and NATO air forces to safely operate within EU territories and to safely project force in other potential areas of operations. The system shall be interoperable with the existing and planned Member States assets and in cross-domain operations.</p><p>Proposals shall address design, development and testing of an escort/modified escort-jamming capability that will be based on state-of-the-art existing technological cores at European industries level.</p><p>The system should follow a modular development approach, being pod mounted in order to be compatible with different aircrafts of interest for the Member States (manned and unmanned).</p><p>The Electronic Attack pod mounted system shall implement a highly efficient phased array based jamming system with powerful, efficient and wideband Gallium-Nitride (GaN) technology.</p><p>The goal of the system is to enable a platform for Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) missions that could adapt to the latest in EW requirements, which include (soft) suppression of enemy air defences, escort/modified-escort role, non-traditional electronic attack, self-protected/time-critical strike support, and continuous capability enhancement.</p><p>Such features shall rely on the ability to locate, record, replay, and jam hostile communications while tracking across an extremely broad frequency range. Maintaining the ability to communicate with allied forces while operating jamming electronics is another critical requirement.</p><p>The escort system would be able to mask an entire fleet of airships from a medium to long range.</p><p>The system shall be designed to break the acquisition cycle of radar installations since the search or early-warning phase of detection. S-band radar installations are the threat most often considered, as they are used in most Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems and other Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) systems.</p><p>The presence of threats in the Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) to X-band range, and their spread in operational frequency and instantaneous bandwidth shall also be considered.</p><p><strong>Targeted activities:</strong></p><p>The proposals shall cover at least:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Concept of operations (CONOPS) definition, system specification, Detailed Requirements Review (DRR) and architecture definition.</li><li>Detailed design of the pod air system, including the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Critical Design Review (CDR).</li> </ul><p>The proposals could also include the development of small-scale technological demonstrators in order to support decision making during the design phase.</p><p>The project will take into account specific requirements from Member States associated to each of the selected air vehicle platforms, in order to perform a design compatible with them, up to the maximum extent possible.</p><p>A detailed planning of the subsequent project phases shall be generated, including the identification of implementation priorities according to operational needs of the Union and Member States. Subsequent phases up to operational readiness shall include in particular: prototypes development, qualification and test activities, to reach incremental operational capabilities.</p><p><strong>Main high-level requirements:</strong></p><p>The proposed system shall be based on a phased array architecture with full 360\u00b0 EW support capability. The system will use the electronic scan nature of this architecture to contend with numerous radar systems.</p><p>The proposed system shall have very high ERP (Effective Radiated Power)<em> </em>effective in all radar polarizations to perform standoff jamming and escort jamming. The frequency coverage shall be valid for electronic attack against air surveillance, target tracker, target indication airborne or ground radars.</p><p>The waveforms generation by the system shall be able to perform any radar waveform including continuous wave signals.</p><p>The system shall be able to detect and perform tracking passively against any radar emission.</p><p>The system shall be able to generate waveforms to perform deception to these radars. Specifically, the system will focus in the capability of reprogramming waveforms to adapt to existing and future threats. An effective air operation can need the use of close-in jamming actions by means of UAV (RPAS) swarms. The system shall be able to control the electronic attack operation of the swarm so performing coordinated electronic attacks. The capability to deliver cyber payload shall also be taken into consideration.</p><p>At the same time, the system will increase back-end system capability with highly sophisticated computer control along with rapid re-programmability and all EW managing functions.</p><p>The system shall offer additional unconventional functionalities: coordinated electronic attack (<em>i.e.</em> cooperative jamming) and precise geolocation and targeting.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<ul level=\"0\"><li>To develop a European electronic attack capability at system level operable from air vehicles. This capability would allow EU air forces to conduct operations in contested EM environment, to deal with low-frequency radars and to counter new sophisticated threats;</li><li>To identify and assure that all key strategic components for this capability are under the sovereignty of EU industry;</li><li>To contribute to the development and competitiveness of EU industries worldwide by incorporating key EW components and systems currently leaded in the market by non-EU industries. To minimize the design and development efforts that would need to be spent separately by EU industries and, consequently, to allow these industries to sooner reach the market and satisfy the requirements of Member States\u2019 armed forces in the field of electronic attack;</li><li>To increase commonality on EW systems, in the area of electronic attack, along the Member States\u2019 armed forces, by joining efforts on this area.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">1.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>List of eligible countries:</strong> Described in section 3 of the call document.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">2.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</strong> Described in section 3 of the call document.</font></p>\n<p>3.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>Evaluation criteria &amp;
