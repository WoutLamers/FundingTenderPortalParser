This assessment acknowledges the necessity to further develop existing land battlefield missile systems.</p><p>Moreover, the development of an EU new generation medium range Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) land battlefield missile systems family has been identified as an objective within the EU BLOS Land Battlefield Missile Systems project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). There is a need to develop a capability providing a high degree of accuracy while avoiding widespread collateral damage, and reducing exposure of friendly forces.</p><p>The EU is facing increasing geopolitical instability and a complex set of conventional and new threats. Therefore, the armed forces of the Member States need the ability to operate autonomously or, as a valuable contributor, within an <em>ad-hoc</em> coalition. They have to intervene in a high intensity and in asymmetric engagement, facing a wide range of threats including potential technically advanced adversaries. Moreover, some requirements are becoming increasingly important:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Providing the land combat units with the ability to defeat at medium range, with a high degree of accuracy and reliability, selected threats that are not always clearly identified and visible, especially in a urban environment, or defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment;</li><li>Reducing exposure to enemy fire;</li><li>Avoiding widespread collateral damage;</li><li>Allowing concentrating fires without concentrating means, providing autonomy, reactivity and freedom of action on the battlefield.</li> </ul><p>In this context, the European BLOS capability will bring a significant operational differentiator to the armed forces of the Member States. Such a capability can be mounted or dismounted on manned and unmanned land platforms, in consistence with the CDP long term analysis which identifies the need to deploy automated effectors to reduce the danger on human personnel or manned platforms.</p><p>Several products and technologies currently exist or are under development in Europe but they need to be integrated in order to achieve this BLOS capability:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>A land battlefield missile system, BLOS native with a full Lock-On After Launch (LOAL) capability, and providing Man-In-The-Loop (MITL) through a seeker back-image for over watch and control during the whole flight of the missile;</li><li>A turret system to support and set up the missile using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for target designation;</li><li>A land platform;</li><li>A UAV providing a cyber-secured target location.</li> </ul><p>In order to guarantee freedom of operational use, capacity to implement further evolutions over time, and standardization of those interfaces with other EU land battle systems, the European BLOS capability has to be built without restraints and restriction from third country or third country entity, in particular regarding IPR and know-how, and must be free of any third party control regime.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The scope of this action includes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The analysis of the operational requirements for a small unit able to deliver autonomously both LOS and BLOS firings, and proposal of operational concept of use through dedicated scenarios;</li><li>The realisation of a full-scale demonstration.</li> </ul><p>The proposals shall include an analysis of the operational needs and of the different technical contributors of the BLOS capacity. The concept of use shall be illustrated by scenarios (timescales, level of performances, cooperation scheme, concept of operations, cybersecurity) which shall involve the platform equipped with the missile and demonstrate the operational interest of the BLOS capability with a stand-alone target designation.</p><p>The demonstration of the BLOS capability shall be based on the realisation of one of the proposed scenarios, showing the different technologies involved. Those technologies shall include at least:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Designation of the target, in terms of coordinates and image, using a UAV adapted to this mission: the flight and functions of the UAV shall be controlled by a specific base, positioned on the battlefield, and related to the platform. The UAV system can use a digital terrain model;</li><li>Transmission of the target coordinates and image by the UAV control base through a cyber-secured data link to the platform (equipped with the missile system and turret) which is not in direct view of the target;</li><li>Reception of the information on the platform which controls the turret in the direction of the target;</li><li>Set up of the missile on the platform, using the target coordinates;</li><li>Firing of the missile;</li><li>Lock on the target by the operator when the missile is in flight, using the image transmitted and the MITL capacity through seeker back-image.</li> </ul><p><strong>Targeted activities:</strong></p><p>This proposal shall cover testing, including the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analysis of the different contributors of the BLOS capacity, leading to specify the operational requirements and man-machine interfaces, taking also into account the availability of the associated technologies and products on the market;</li><li>Realisation of interviews with skilled actors of the battlefield: the discussions shall be based on the operational needs and constraints and shall be illustrated using a dedicated missile system simulation environment with MITL and seeker back-image functionality;</li><li>Proposal of a concept of use, illustrated with different scenarios demonstrating the operational advantage brought by the BLOS capacity.</li><li>Choice of the demonstration scenario among those proposed and defined previously;</li><li>Preparation of the scenario in the selected test centre, and associated safety studies;</li><li>Preparation of the platform (vehicle);</li><li>Adaptation and prototyping of the missile system to the platform (turret);</li><li>Adaptation of the UAV, in particular interfaces for data transmission;</li><li>Functional validation of the whole system;</li><li>Availability of two missiles (one spare);</li><li>Realization of the demonstration with a live firing.</li> </ul><p><strong>Main high-level requirements:</strong></p><p>The main operational requirements for this action are the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The system shall have the capacity to be operable day and night;</li><li>The system shall have an operational range up to 5 km;</li><li>The system shall be easily adapted to allow the firing demonstration;</li><li>The UAV shall have the capability to design a target, in terms of coordinates in the referential common to the platform with the required accuracy;</li><li>The UAV shall be independent, as an objective, from a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) system;</li><li>The UAV data link shall be cyber robust (to its control base), the cyber aspects being fully controlled by Member States;</li><li>The missile shall have the capability to fire on visible and non-visible targets using target coordinates and associated image;</li><li>The missile shall have a back-image capability to lock on the target during flight on operator action in the platform;</li><li>The technologies and components of the system shall be built with a European design authority, must not contain any IPR generated outside Europe and must be free of any third party control regime;</li><li>The firing demonstration shall be carried out in suitable European Union test centre, allowing for proving the BLOS capability with the stand-alone target designation (The target designation is made by the operator of the missile system<em>)</em> of the system;</li><li>The system shall be able to fulfil the firing range\u2019s safety requirements;</li><li>The experimental devices associated to the firing demonstration shall be able to record the relevant characteristics of the firing / engagement sequences (data links communications between the different units, impact precision of the missile on target, back image from the missile seeker through data link, <em>etc.</em>);</li><li>The live firings results shall be compared with the simulation of the missile system with MITL capability.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The expected impact of this action for the Member States should be: </p><ul level=\"0\"><li> Contribution to excellence with the demonstration of a significant advantage over existing defence products or technologies;</li><li> Contribution to innovation through the application of technologies or concepts previously not applied in the defence sector;</li><li> Contribution to competitiveness by creating new market opportunities;</li><li> Contribution to the security and defence interests of Europe and to industrial autonomy;</li><li> Contribution to increased interoperability and potential European standards.</li> </ul>\n",
