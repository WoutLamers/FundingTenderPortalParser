In addition to the past decade\u2019s focus on peacekeeping, anti-piracy and patrol operation, navies will also have to operate again in the upper end of the spectrum in terms of threat and intensity, to sail in more remote and extended areas and reduce the need of highly skilled embedded crews. This translates into:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li> Stronger emphasis on detectability, survivability, perseverance and battle hardening;</li><li> Capabilities to sail and operate in more demanding conditions, in particular extreme climates both tropic and arctic;</li><li> Worldwide operation and permanent protection of the exploitation of marine resources and sea lines of communication against all kind of threats;</li><li> Sea-basing at a large scale;</li><li> Increased adaptability to different mission-profiles both in a solo role or as part of a flotilla;</li><li> Reduced crew ship operation through autonomy and automation;</li><li> Increased operational availability of naval assets;</li><li> Emphasis on emission reductions and energy efficiency improvements;</li><li> Integration of new weapon systems against new short or long-range threats and targets.</li> </ul><p>The first challenge in developing a new generation of naval vessels is not the concept itself but the development of technologies that once integrated form the essence of the concept. This requires common feasibility studies to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the potential and the impact of integrating such technologies on a platform and its payload.</p><p>With several Member States currently undergoing replacement programmes for their navies, the results of the study should lay ground for the development of recommendations about potential building blocks within the European Defence Fund and/or at national level.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>To address these challenges, the study should be structured around the investigation of the potential impact of a number of existing as well as future systems and technologies on the performance of a naval platform, in a high-level threat environment (surface and subsurface).</p><p>New development are relevant, such as those having a high impact on capabilities to conduct missions and to increase adaptability to different mission-profiles; detectability; survivability against modern threats; ship-motion control; electric power generation and storage; capability to operate in extreme climates; increased autonomy &amp; automation and connectivity to sea port.</p><p>The feasibility study should recommend a number of game-changing developments in the framework of EDF, to bring the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) and SRL (System Readiness Level) level of the block to its maximum.</p><p><strong>Targeted activities:</strong></p><p>The proposals shall cover a study over a period of maximum 30 months.</p><p><strong>Main high-level requirements:</strong></p><p>Based on the CDP recommendation, the feasibility study shall address the following issues:</p><p><u>1. Lower detectability</u></p><p>The level at which a naval platform is detectable by adversaries is a major consideration when confronted by those adversaries.</p><p>The study shall address to what extent ship signatures can be further reduced or augmented compared to today\u2019s levels and/or camouflaged in order both to minimize detectability and improve effectiveness of own sensors and soft kill measures. Signature management in off-design conditions shall be addressed too.</p><p>Solutions to make the vessel invisible for radar (RCS (Radar Cross Section)), to mitigate the effect of the earth magnetic field, radiated noise, infrared and other energy sources shall be studied as well as measures to improve the stealth capability against interrogating acoustic, electromagnetic and hydrodynamic sensor systems. Solutions for signature modelling shall be studied as well.</p><p><u>2. Higher survivability against modern surface and subsurface threats including against high-speed threats and swarming threats</u></p><p>Ultimately, the cheapest way to strengthen our defence is to prolong the use and survivability of a naval weapon-system in a confrontation. A focus on technologies also applicable for on service ships will be specifically considered</p><p>The study shall look into solutions for:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved redundancy, protection and damage containment;</li><li>Blast and shock tolerant structures;</li><li>Capability to recover lost fighting / sailing / floating capabilities (reconfiguration, self-mending / healing systems);</li><li>New advanced and light weight armoured materials (active armouring, ceramic armouring, protection against RPG7-like anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher, in particular for bridge protection);</li><li>Innovative lay-outs;</li> </ul><p>The study shall also take into account the latest developments in future weapon systems and sensors including the effect it will have on the development of the platform solutions.</p><p><u>3. Reduction of ship motions</u></p><p>Operations with helicopters, UAV/USV (Unmanned Air Vehicle/Unmanned Surface vehicle) and UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) systems are limited to a window set by ship motions. Solutions are multi-faceted and offer a lot of potential improvements.</p><p>New developments offer new opportunities to control ship motion in all direction and thus extend the use of the above-mentioned systems. The following developments shall be addressed:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Naval architecture: identify architecture options for hull shapes and appendages, allowing gains in sea keeping and minimizing vertical accelerations;</li><li>Improvement of stabilization: new stabilization modes (mobile mass, active foils...);</li><li>Operation in higher sea states;</li><li>Use of prediction: measuring and calculating waves in advance and evaluating their impact, motion sensors;</li><li>Interactions with other systems: UxS (Unmanned Systems), aircraft, small vessels;</li><li>Human factors: improve crew working condition to operate the ship (aided system for environment perception like artificial horizon, systems reducing impact of motion, <em>etc.</em>).</li> </ul><p>The study shall investigate the potential of these (combined) developments for frigate sized platforms and formulate required further steps.</p><p><u>4. Improved electric power generation and storage</u></p><p>Innovative solutions to cater for a new generation of energy-demanding weapons such as laser and electro-magnetic guns, as well as to comply with the requirements of environmental legislation, will be necessary.</p><p>The study shall look into the potential of energy efficiency improvements, and their impacts and integration challenges of the use and development of alternative fuels, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, sustainable sources, LED (Light-Emitting Diode) sources smart electric power distribution: \"NAVAL GRID\" (modelling \u2013 simulation), new power to thrust conversion systems and new materials / improved yields.</p><p><u>5. Capability to operate in extreme climates</u></p><p>Taking into account the changing political importance of remote geographical areas as well as the effects caused by climate change in terms of more extreme weather conditions and the access to so far closed-off areas (artic, ant-artic) future naval systems design will face additional requirements such as:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Ice strengthening;</li><li>More stringent requirements for on-board platform systems : air-conditioning, lower operating temperatures, <em>etc</em>.;</li><li>Insulation.</li> </ul><p><u>6. Topside</u></p><p>The purpose is to study topside technologies in order to cover permanently around 360\u00b0 and to use simultaneously all integrated sensors and radiating effectors. The main topics are:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analyse and evaluate innovative antenna technologies (meta materials, ferro fluid, plasma\u2026);</li><li>Identify and evaluate design and validation EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) tools for integrated topside;</li><li>Feasibility study for topside functional and physical integration (interface standardization);</li><li>Analyse the feasibility of topside functional ship wall.</li> </ul><p><u>7. Increased autonomy and automation</u></p><p>To enable further crew reduction and autonomy at system level, the study shall also address the technologies and systems relevant to damage control, firefighting, replenishment at sea, close proximity manoeuvres.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>The feasibility study results shall:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Set up a common definition to identify future naval systems and technologies;</li><li>Define the state-of-the-art of the identified naval systems and technologies;</li><li>Deliver an analysis of the potential improvements, impacts and related cost of their integration into a surface or subsurface platform;</li><li>Develop concrete requirement to enable further development and their successful integration on-board future naval platforms;</li><li>Elaborate concrete recommendation and proposals for further development programmes, within the EU or national frameworks.</li> </ul>\n", "conditions": "<p><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">1.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>List of eligible countries:</strong> Described in section 3 of the call document.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">2.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</strong> Described in section 3 of the call document.</font></p>\n<p>3.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span><strong>Evaluation criteria &amp;
