They revolutionised military applications by providing accurate position, velocity and time/synchronisation information for all military assets worldwide, in all weather conditions, with a common time and geodetic reference frame supporting the essential interoperability requirement. Galileo has been developed to guarantee Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy in Satellite navigation. The Galileo PRS has been developed as a robust, secure and resilient PNT service even in case of denial of the other GNSS services. Interoperable and compatible with GPS, the PRS will provide the EU military users state-of-the-art satellite navigation performance, robustness and interoperability and, when combined with GPS, an even higher level of resilience for military use.</p><p>The CDP points to the need to promote the development of robust, secure and resilient EU military PNT capabilities. To achieve this objective in time (with regard to the Galileo PRS Full Orbital Capability (FOC) foreseen by 2023), operational EU military PRS receivers, associated to their antennas and key management facilities as well as service architectures and test and support facilities, need to be developed and those developments cannot be supported by the private sector, because of the high investment cost. In addition, the development of military standardized Galileo PRS receiver interfaces has been identified as an objective within the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). This standardisation will ensure the development of the EU market by facilitating the integration of PRS receivers into the armament systems. It will then increase the competitiveness and growth of the defence industry for those armament systems (the satellite navigation capabilities embedded are one of the criteria of choice for armament systems within the military market).</p><p>The EU activities supported so far have been feasibility studies, design activity and accreditation of one pre operational prototype.</p><p>Therefore, the challenge is to develop EU operational prototypes of PRS receivers with standardized interfaces, to be qualified and tested by FOC (2023) within at least one host platform. Testing in standardized and controllable test facilities as well as in a real environment with in-field demonstrations implementing real/realistic service architecture must be scheduled with the involvement of defence user communities.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Proposals shall address the development of European standardized and sovereign Galileo PRS navigation receiver capabilities compatible with GPS/PRS solution for military purposes in air, land, naval domains developed in full conformity with the EU Common Minimum Standards (CMS) from prototyping up to qualification or test.
