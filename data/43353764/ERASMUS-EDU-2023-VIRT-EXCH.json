They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education (both formal and non-formal) without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of international educational experiences. Digital platforms represent a valuable tool in partially answering the global constraints on mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual exchanges also help spreading European values. Moreover, in some cases they can prepare, deepen and extend physical exchanges, as well as fuel new demand for them.</p><p>Virtual exchanges take place in small groups and are always moderated by a trained facilitator. They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.</p><p><em><u>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</u></em></p><p>The action will aim to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;</li><li>Promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;</li><li>Enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;</li><li>Foster the digital and soft skills (i.e. Soft skills include the ability to think critically, be curious and creative, to take initiative, to solve problems and work collaboratively, to be able to communicate efficiently in a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment, to be able to adapt to context and to cope with stress and uncertainty. These skills are part of the key competences, as outlined in the Council Recommendation on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning (OJ C 189/1 of 4.6.2018)) development of students, young people and youth workers (i.e. Youth workers are professional or volunteers involved in non-formal learning who support young people in their personal socio-educational and professional development), including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;</li><li>Promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;</li><li>Strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries.</li> </ul><p><u><em>THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</em></u></p><p>The Erasmus+ Virtual Exchanges are a bottom-up initiative. In this call, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the above-mentioned objectives (see also \u2018Expected impact\u2019 section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects\u2019 scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility. Since virtual exchanges are easier to organise with students and universities, applicants are encouraged to involve young people and organisations not enrolled in higher education.</p><p><u><em>ACTIVITIES</em></u></p><p>Projects will be funded based on work plans that may integrate a wide range of online cooperation activities, including for example:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Online-facilitated discussions between young people of youth organisations based in different countries, as part of youth projects. They could include role playing simulations;</li><li>Training for youth workers willing to develop a virtual exchange project with colleagues from other countries;</li><li>Online facilitated discussions between students of Higher Education institutions based in different countries, as part of higher education degrees;</li><li>Training for university professors/staff willing to develop a virtual exchange project with colleagues from other countries;</li><li>Interactive open online courses including traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets (like the well-known MOOCs, Massive Open Online Courses, but putting an emphasis on interactive user forums in small groups to support community interactions among students, professors, teaching assistants, young people and youth workers).</li> </ul><p><em><u>SETTING UP A PROJECT </u></em></p><p>All virtual exchange projects need to be:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Moderated by trained facilitators;</li><li>Secure and protective from the perspective of participants and hosts, in full compliance of the EU data protection rules (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/eu-data-protection-rules_en);</li><li>Politically sound and culturally relevant: virtual exchange activities must be firmly embedded in the youth and higher education sectors and be up to date with young people\u2019s online and offline cultures in the participating countries;</li><li>Open and accessible at user experience and interaction level. Registration and interactions with peers, facilitators, administrators, and other stakeholders should be straightforward and easy;</li><li>Mainly synchronously, with possible asynchronous components (e.g. readings, videos); and</li><li>finally, they must foresee a method of recognition of participation and learning for young people at the end of the exchange.</li> </ul><p>Participant organisations must arrange virtual exchanges for people in the 13-30 age range. If a project involves people under 18, participating organisations are required to obtain prior authorisation for participation from their parents or those acting on their behalf. Individual participants must be based in the countries of the organisations participating in the project.</p><p>In order to carry out their activities, projects should rely, as far as possible, on existing tools and platforms.</p><p><u><em>WHICH ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE MET TO APPLY FOR VIRTUAL EXCHANGES IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND YOUTH PROJECTS?

Furthermore, they must score at least half of the maximum score points in each of the categories of award criteria mentioned above (i.e. minimum 15 points for the categories \"relevance of the project\" and \"impact\"; 10 points for the categories \"quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements\" and \u201cquality of the project design and implementation\u201d).</p><p>In case of ex aequo, priority will be given to projects scoring highest under the criterion \"relevance of the project\" and then \u201cimpact\u201d.</p><p><u><em>GEOGRAPHICAL TARGETS</em></u></p><p>The EU\u2019s external action instruments are contributing to this action. The budget available is divided between different regions and the size of each budgetary envelope is different. Further information on the amounts available under each budgetary envelope will be published on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP).</p><p>Sub-Saharan Africa: Priority will be given to least developed countries in this region; a special emphasis shall also be put on migration priority countries (i.e. the following are migration key third countries not associated to the Programme: Burkina-Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, South Sudan, and Sudan); no country will access more than 8% of funding foreseen for this region.</p><p>As a general rule, and within the limits of existing national and European legal frameworks, results should be made available as open educational resources (OER) as well as on relevant professional, sectorial or competent authorities\u2019 platforms. The proposal will describe how data, materials, documents and audio-visual and social media activity produced will be made freely available and promoted through open licences, and does not contain disproportionate limitations.</p><p><u><em>WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?</em></u></p><p>This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.</p><p>The EU grant per project will be of a maximum of 500 000 \u20ac, with EUR 200 as maximum investment to organisations per participant (i.e. a project of 500 000 \u20ac would have to reach at least 2 500 participants). The grant awarded may be lower than the amount requested.</p><p>How is the project lump sum determined?</p><p>Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table in the application form, taking into account the following points:</p><p>a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into \u2018project management\u2019, \u2018training\u2019, \u2018organization of events\u2019, \u2018mobility preparation and implementation\u2019, \u2018communication and dissemination\u2019, \u2018quality assurance\u2019, etc.);</p><p>b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;</p><p>c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);</p><p>d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such us dissemination of information, publishing or translation).</p><p>Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals, against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action.</p><p>Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 95% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation</p><p>The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement. Financial support to third parties is not allowed. Volunteer and SME costs are allowed. Please refer to Part C of this Programme Guide, to the section on \u2018Eligible Direct Costs\u2019. The proposal must include costs for two meetings (up to two persons per application) per year organised by or at the initiative of the European Commission.</p><p>The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.</p><p>More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP).</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies.</p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24).</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.</p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, , including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.</p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities.</p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 26, 2023 4:28:27 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 26, 2023 4:28:27 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box;
