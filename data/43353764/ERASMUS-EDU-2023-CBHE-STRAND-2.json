They shall introduce new approaches and initiatives in higher education, based on peer learning and transfer of experience and good practice affecting not only the institutions but also the society at large. Partnerships for transformation in higher education are complex and innovative capacity building projects based on a transfer of experience, competencies and good practice with a range of interconnected activities that aim to strengthen the capacities of the targeted HEIs to address the 21<sup>st</sup> century challenges such as migration, climate change, governance and shifts towards a digital economy. The projects\u2019 outcomes should have a significant and long-term impact on the targeted HEIs beyond the projects' lifetime and as such benefitting the society as a whole.</p><p>In particular, these projects will combine the following elements for the benefit of HEIs in the third countries not associated to the Programme:</p><p><strong>Innovation in higher education</strong> in order to enhance its relevance for the labour market and the society. It is expected that the proposed projects address mismatches between the requirements of employers and the offer of higher education institutions and propose integral solutions to enhance better employability of students. This can be done by implementing comprehensive interventions that include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the design of innovative curricula and introducing innovative elements in the existing curricula;</li><li>the implementation of innovative learning and teaching methods (i.e. learner-centred and real problem-based teaching and learning);</li><li>the active engagement with the business world and with research, the organisation of continuing educational programmes and activities with and within enterprises;</li><li>the strengthening of the capacities of HEIs in the third countries not associated to the Programme to network effectively in research, scientific and technological innovation.</li> </ul><p><strong>Promoting reform in HEIs</strong> to become catalysts of economic and social development in the third countries not associated to the Programme. Projects should support HEIs to develop and implement the institutional reforms that will make them more democratic, inclusive, equitable and full-fledged constituents of the civil society. Institutional reforms include new governance and management systems and structures, readiness in terms of digital skills, modern university services, quality assurance processes, tools and methods for professionalisation and professional development of academic, technical and administrative staff. The development of an entrepreneurial mind-set and improved competencies and skills within the institutions are key aspects for the success of this Strand. Transversal skills learning, entrepreneurship education and the practical application of entrepreneurial skills will enable HEIs to put their knowledge and resources at the service of their local/national/regional communities.</p><p><strong><u>Overarching priorities to be covered by projects under Strand 2</u></strong></p><p>Each applicant will need to identify in Part C of the application form <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of the <strong>overarching priorities</strong>, which are defined by the European Commission per Region.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>For <strong>Regions 1 to 3</strong> <strong>sub-priorities</strong> have also been defined (see Part C of the application form). Within the overarching priority identified by the applicant, the project must chose mandatorily <strong><u>only one</u></strong> sub-priority.</li><li>For <strong>Regions 5 to 11 <u>only</u> overarching priorities</strong> exist and <strong><u>only one</u></strong> of them must be chosen by the project.</li> </ul><p><strong>Please note</strong>: The overarching priorities for Region 7 (Middle East) and Region 8 (Pacific) are applicable only for multi-national projects involving more than one Regions.</p><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions 1-3</strong></p><p><strong>Region 1: Western Balkans</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should promote long-term economic recovery by increasing the Region\u2019s competitiveness and stimulating green jobs. Priority areas include climate, environment, circular economy and fighting pollution. Projects should pave the way to a climate neutral society by supporting reforms of education systems in order to guarantee that people are equipped and prepared for the labour market and society of tomorrow.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should support the development and uptake of digital skills to make the digital transformation as comprehensive and inclusive as possible. Encourage development and implementation of digital education strategies. Accompany the digital transition by mainstreaming digitalisation in education systems and reinforcing programmes covering digital skills. Provide assistance to teacher training and online education learning.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Projects should promote mobility and in particular, support recognition of degrees and credentials in the Region, and contribute to a regional credit transfer system to enable intra-regional connectivity and building a regional higher education area.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>Address regional structural weaknesses by supporting cooperation and/or reforms in the areas of governance, rule of law and the fight against corruption. Project proposals centred on health governance are encouraged, particularly those linked to preparedness and resilience.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Quality education is a key factor for securing growth and jobs and for addressing challenges linked to unemployment and skills mismatches. Investing in human capital and entrepreneurship helps societies to prepare for the future, by putting a halt to brain drain and supporting the transition to a knowledge-based economy. A key objective is to tackle the existing mismatch between education outcomes and labour market demands, including through the development of work-based learning. Inclusiveness participation of all citizens, including Roma, in education and training systems will ensure that no one is left behind.</p><p><strong>Region 2: Neighbourhood East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Support the modernisation of economies, making them more competitive and innovative, while ensuring the green transition towards climate neutrality. Research &amp; innovation initiatives are to focus upon climate change mitigation and adaptation, the greening of cities, promotion and implementation of new sustainable value chains and green skills &amp; jobs. Academic cooperation should help provide answers to public demands on urban and rural development, energy efficiency, health and natural resource and waste management.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Foster an effective, inclusive and gender-sensitive digital transformation in education and science, in the first place by addressing the digital skills gap. Priority areas in the digital strand include the development of connectivity solutions empowering citizens through the improvement of digital skills and digital literacy, distance learning, and learning and teaching innovations, specifically in remote and rural areas and vulnerable communities. Priority should also be given to fostering links between Education, Research and Business in the area of digitalisation. Calls related to Data infrastructure, Data management and SME/business digitalisation are encouraged.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Support education initiatives contributing to the development of a regional higher education area, particularly credit transfer systems and qualification, degree and credential recognition. Provide for the integration of migrants and displaced persons by granting access to education, including language education and scholarships.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Contribute to an area of democracy, prosperity, stability, security and increased cooperation between resilient and inclusive societies sharing common values. Projects should notably focus on rule of law reforms, protection of human rights, the fight against corruption and discrimination, media literacy, the role of an independent media and civil society and promotion of gender equality.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Investing in young people and better connecting education, research and innovation with private sector needs are crucial building blocks in achieving economies that work for all. Areas of particular focus are teacher training, youth entrepreneurship, the offer and uptake of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) skills, and related gender inclusiveness. Linkages with the green transition towards climate neutrality should be stressed. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote areas, including rural areas.</p><p><strong>Region 3: South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal: </em></strong>Projects should contribute to an inclusive, long-term socio-economic recovery and tap into the Region\u2019s economic potential by supporting the circular and green economy as well as urban development. Priorities include increasing climate awareness, sustainability and resilience, specifically in the key sectors of agriculture, energy and water management. Furthermore, academic cooperation should aim to provide applicable answers to environmental challenges, including desertification, biodiversity loss and use of natural resources.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation: </em></strong>Projects should seize the digital transition by working on digital literacy, skills and entrepreneurship. In parallel, digital solutions can provide new means to reach out to vulnerable communities. Cooperation opportunities also lie in digital infrastructure and connections, where heightened reliability, capacity and security will support regional economic integration.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants: </em></strong>Education access for displaced persons and refugees is a priority objective for the entire Region. Support intra-regional initiatives on credential and degree recognition as well as regional credit transfer systems. Opportunities and jobs, as referred to in the other regional priorities, should be inclusive of all, including migrants and displaced persons.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development: </em></strong>Commitment to the rule of law, human and fundamental rights, equality, democracy and good governance are the bedrock of stable, fair and prosperous societies. Initiatives on peace and security, intercultural dialogue and women empowerment are encouraged, hereby driving respect for diversity, tolerance and strengthening the Mediterranean partnership.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs: </em></strong>Improving education systems governance and addressing structural causes of schools dropouts are crucial to meet youth aspirations and to address persisting economic and gender inequalities. An integral part to this process is developing primary and secondary teacher education and in-service training. Stronger linkages between the academic, research and business world are to be stimulated, with education programmes addressing current and future skills needs, not in the least entrepreneurship. Innovation hubs and start-ups help generate local employment opportunities and prevent brain drain. Particular attention is to be paid to women participation.</p><p><strong>Overarching Priorities in Regions 5-11</strong></p><p><strong>Region 5: </strong><strong>Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should respond to the growing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation in Asia and provide capacities for climate-resilient studies to provide solutions to environmental challenges in the Region. Projects should also support the green and economic transition in Asia by strengthening links with the private sector and by enhancing the knowledge and skills needed for a modern work force.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Promoting digital technologies and services will foster socio-economic development in Asia. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide in Asia by promoting and developing digital literacy and skills as well as support the digital economy and connectivity through digital education strategies.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Projects should promote mobility and in particular support the recognition of degrees and credentials in Asia, also to support intra-regional connectivity. Projects should support the integration of migrants and displaced persons through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To advance social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity such as for democratic governance, human development, and intercultural dialogue, thereby exposing the Region to European best practices in this regard.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Due to Asia\u2019s<strong> </strong>economic dynamism, projects should support the upskilling of the young population in Asia. Projects should also help to identify education gaps that<strong> </strong>can contribute to economic growth and jobs, while exporting the EU\u2019s sustainable growth and governance model.</p><p><strong>Region 6: Central Asia</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> One of the objectives of the EU in the Region is to accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy, as Central Asia has a great potential for green energy. Projects should thus accelerate the transition towards a green and circular economy and tackle trans-regional environmental challenges through accompanying links with the private sector as well as enhanced study and educational capacities.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The development of skills will be key to Central Asia\u2019s competitiveness and social cohesion. Projects should promote knowledge-based economies and enhance synergies between education systems and the labour market, and should be linked with promoting digital literacy and skills.</p><p><strong>Region 7: Middle East</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Projects should contribute to a green and sustainable economic recovery and transition as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation by supporting reforms of education systems and by strengthening links with the private sector, while also exposing higher education institutions in the Region to European practices.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Projects should support the Region\u2019s diversification and sustainable development and address the mismatch between the education system and needs of the labour market, also providing support to team up with the private sector, to foster economies that work for all. Projects could be linked with the <em>Green Deal</em> priority by enhancing educational capacities concerning the Region\u2019s green transition.</p><p><strong>Region 8: Pacific</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> There is no other Region in the world more threatened by climate change and engaged in climate action, as environmental degradation greatly hampers deeper development in the Pacific. Projects should therefore help to modernise economies in the Region by establishing links with the private sector, as well as creating knowledge and capacity to help the Region further adapt to climate change and a changing work dynamic.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> The countries of the Pacific Region suffer from a very narrow market size, offering very few job opportunities. Projects should support the creation of stable and reliable internal repositories of knowledge and competencies, avoiding a brain drain and enhancing the domestic education systems. In this respect, one of the main cornerstones will be the development of the \u201cblue economy\u201d concept.</p><p><strong>Region 9: Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Contribute to a successful green and sustainable global economic recovery (including climate change, environment and energy), awareness-raising, green jobs.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Performing digital education eco-systems, improving digital skills and competences, connectivity, teacher training.</p><p><strong><em>Integration of migrants:</em></strong> Recognition of qualifications, legal pathways, integration of migrants and displaced persons, education access, scholarships, language education.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Human rights, social and economic rights, democracy, fundamental values, governance, citizenship, health, youth, gender, access and inclusion.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Skills, entrepreneurship, employability, links to the labour market and jobs creation, job opportunities, rural areas, private sector involvement.</p><p><strong>Region 10: Latin America</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Latin American countries are key partners for a global transition towards a greener and climate neutral development path. The Region is home to around of 50% of the global biodiversity and has a tremendous potential for renewable, but also is highly vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Projects should respond to those environmental challenges enhancing capacities in the Region. Projects should also support the private sector for their green and economic transition and enhance the needed knowledge and skills.</p><p><strong><em>Digital transformation:</em></strong> Digital transformation can support sustainable recovery in Latin American countries, address traps and increase competitiveness. Projects should help to bridge the digital divide, developing digital literacy and skills, as well as scientific, technical and innovation capacities fostering links between education, research and business. Earth observation and spatial technologies allow increasing climate change mitigation and creating innovation paths.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> Strengthening social cohesion remains a priority for the Region, which is the most unequal of the world. Projects should contribute to build inclusive societies by developing awareness and strengthening capacities in areas such as education, health, gender equality, access and inclusion, human rights, including social, economic, and cultural rights. Particular attention should be given to vulnerable communities as well as remote and rural areas. Projects support intra-regional connectivity and contribute to the development of the Higher Education Area, particularly the recognition of degrees and credit transfer systems and qualifications. Projects should support as well the integration of migrants, refugees and displaced persons through the access to education.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> To accompany the Region to a sustainable inclusive economic recovery, projects should put the accent to respond to the needs of emerging sectors, as green, blue, digital and orange economy. Projects should also help to identify education gaps in the different areas in close cooperation with the private sector.</p><p><strong>Region 11: Caribbean</strong></p><p><strong><em>Green Deal:</em></strong> Two main elements have a critical impact on the Caribbean: i) climate change and natural disasters and ii) unsustainable production and excessive generation of waste. Both put the Caribbean marine and terrestrial ecosystems under pressure and vulnerable to external shocks. Projects should contribute to adapt to climate change and reduce risks in areas as transition to low-carbon economies, renewable energy, waste management, agri-food value chains.</p><p><strong><em>Governance, peace, security and human development:</em></strong> To contribute to more inclusive and resilient societies and advance on social cohesion, projects should create knowledge, awareness as well as capacity in areas as education, health, gender equality and inclusiveness.</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable growth and jobs:</em></strong> Developing knowledge, in connection with the labour market needs, in areas with growth potential (such as creative industries and services) and emerging sectors (blue, green, and digital economy) can generate a multiplying effect. Projects can contribute to find regional solutions to common challenges such as connectivity and regional integration, as well reducing youth unemployment rates and brain drain.</p><p><strong><u>The indicative 2023 CBHE budget of Strand 2 per Region (in EURO)</u></strong> and the indicative number of projects to be funded are defined below.</p><p>In the Regions where the indicative budget is indicated as zero, normally projects in these Regions cannot be funded.</p><p>Please note that there is a flexibility of transferring budgets between the Strands.</p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong><em>Regions</em></strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong><em> Indicative budget for Strand 2</em></strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong><em> Indicative n\u00b0 of projects</em></strong></p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 1 Western Balkans</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 5.088.190</p> </td>    <td> <p> 6</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 2 Neighbourhood East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 10.093.249</p> </td>    <td> <p> 12</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 3 South-Mediterranean countries</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 5.063.394</p> </td>    <td> <p> 6</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 5 Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 14.815.872</p> </td>    <td> <p> 18</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 6 Central Asia</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 3.913.241</p> </td>    <td> <p> 4</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 7 Middle East</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 0</p> </td>    <td> <p> 0</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 8 Pacific</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 0</p> </td>    <td> <p> 0</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 9 Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 11.344.025</p> </td>    <td> <p> 14</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 10 Latin America</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 7.593.110</p> </td>    <td> <p> 9</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Region 11 Caribbean</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p> 794.354</p> </td>    <td> <p> 1</p> </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Total 2023 CBHE indicative budget of Strand 2 and indicative number of projects to be funded</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong> 58.705.435</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p><strong> 70</strong></p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the Programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies.</p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24).</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ Programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.</p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.</p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</p><p>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities.</p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 16, 2023 3:21:55 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 16, 2023 3:21:55 PM", "content": "<p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Call </span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:&#10;10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#333333;background:white;&#10;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE has closed on the 28/02/2023.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#333333;&#10;background:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">790 proposals have been submitted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#333333;&#10;background:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">The breakdown per topic is:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\r\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"color:#333333;text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;     mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:white;mso-ansi-language:&#10;     EN-US\"><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.testa.eu/CPS/pages/call/call.jsf\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:windowtext;text-decoration:&#10;     none;text-underline:none\">ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE-STRAND-1</span></a>: 97      proposals<o:p></o:p></span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"color:#333333;text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;     mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:white;mso-ansi-language:&#10;     EN-US\"><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.testa.eu/CPS/pages/call/call.jsf\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:black;text-decoration:none;&#10;     text-underline:none\">ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE-STRAND-2</span></a>: 627      proposals<o:p></o:p></span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"color:#333333;text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;     mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:white;mso-ansi-language:&#10;     EN-US\"><a href=\"https://webgate.ec.testa.eu/CPS/pages/call/call.jsf\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:windowtext;text-decoration:&#10;     none;text-underline:none\">ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE-STRAND-3</span></a>: 66      proposals<o:p></o:p></span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;color:#333333;background:white;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\">Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in July 2023.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 14, 2023 4:28:50 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 14, 2023 4:28:50 PM", "content": "<p>Dear applicant, please note that the submission deadline for the call <strong>ERASMUS-EDU-2023-CBHE</strong> has been postponed to the following new dates: <strong>28 February 2023, 17.00 Brussels time</strong>.
