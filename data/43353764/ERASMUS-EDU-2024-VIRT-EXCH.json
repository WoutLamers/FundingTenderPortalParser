They make it possible for every young person to access high-quality international and cross-cultural education without physical mobility. While virtual debating or training does not fully replace the benefits of physical mobility, participants in virtual exchanges ought to reap some of the benefits of international educational experiences. Digital platforms represent a valuable tool in partially answering the global constraints on mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual exchanges also help spreading European values. Moreover, in some cases, virtual exchanges can give ideas and prepare the ground for future physical exchanges not funded under this action .</p><p>Virtual exchanges take place in small groups and are always moderated by a trained facilitator. They should be easily integrated into youth (non-formal education) projects or higher education courses. Virtual exchanges can draw participants from both sectors, even if, depending on specific projects, they could involve participants from either only one of them or from both. All projects under this call will involve organisations and participants coming from both EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme, and third countries not associated to the Programme in eligible regions.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</strong></p><p>The action will aim to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Encourage intercultural dialogue with third countries not associated to the Programme and increase tolerance through online people-to-people interactions, building on digital, youth-friendly technologies;</li><li>Promote various types of virtual exchanges as a complement to Erasmus+ physical mobility, allowing more young people to benefit from intercultural and international experience;</li><li>Enhance critical thinking and media literacy, particularly in the use of internet and social media, such as to counter discrimination, indoctrination, polarization and violent radicalisation;</li><li>Foster the digital and soft skills development of students, young people and youth workers, including the practice of foreign languages and teamwork, notably to enhance employability;</li><li>Promote citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education;</li><li>Strengthen the youth dimension in the relations of the EU with third countries.</li> </ul><p><strong>THEMATIC AREAS / SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</strong></p><p>The Virtual Exchanges should be organised in one or more of the following thematic areas, which correspond to the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Inclusion and diversity;</li><li>Digital transformation;</li><li>Environment and fight against climate change;</li><li>Participation in democratic life, common values and civic engagement.</li> </ul><p>Within this broad framework, since Virtual Exchanges are a bottom-up initiative, participating organisations are free to choose the topics on which they will focus, but proposals must demonstrate their expected impact in relation to one or more of the objectives mentioned above (see also \u2018Expected impact\u2019 section below). Gender aspects should be taken into account as needed, depending on the projects\u2019 scope and themes (e.g. by introducing gender sensitivity aspects in the trainings). Special attention needs to be given to the inclusion of socially and economically vulnerable people and persons unable to apply for physical mobility.</p><p><strong>ACTIVITIES</strong></p><p>Projects will be funded based on work plans that integrate online cooperation activities, including:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Online-facilitated discussions between young people of youth organisations based in different countries, as part of youth projects. They could include role playing simulations;</li><li>Training for youth workers willing to develop a virtual exchange project with colleagues from other countries;</li><li>Online facilitated discussions between students of Higher Education institutions based in different countries, as part of higher education degrees;</li><li>Training for university professors/staff willing to develop a virtual exchange project with colleagues from other countries;</li><li>Interactive open online courses including traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets (like the well-known MOOCs, Massive Open Online Courses, but putting an emphasis on interactive user forums in small groups to support community interactions among students, professors, teaching assistants, young people and youth workers).</li> </ul><p><strong>SETTING UP A PROJECT</strong></p><p>All virtual exchange projects need to be:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Moderated by trained facilitators;</li><li>Secure and protective from the perspective of participants and hosts, in full compliance of the EU data protection rules;</li><li>Politically sound and culturally relevant: virtual exchange activities must be firmly embedded in the youth and higher education sectors and be up to date with young people\u2019s online and offline cultures in the participating countries;</li><li>Open and accessible at user experience and interaction level. Registration and interactions with peers, facilitators, administrators, and other stakeholders should be straightforward and easy;</li><li>Mainly synchronously, with possible asynchronous components (e.g. readings, videos);</li><li>Finally, they must foresee a method of recognition of participation and learning outcomes for young people at the end of the exchange.</li> </ul><p>Participant organisations must arrange virtual exchanges for people in the 13-30 age range. If a project involves people under 18, participating organisations are required to obtain prior authorisation for participation from their parents or those acting on their behalf. Individual participants must be based in the countries of the organisations participating in the project.</p><p>In order to carry out their activities, projects should rely, as far as possible, on existing tools and platforms.</p><p>Further information can be found on the dedicated page of the Programme Guide (erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide), please check the latest version for 2024.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b>1.&nbsp;</b><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\">Eligible countries</b>:&nbsp;as described in the Call document.</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AC_202301262\" target=\"_blank\">EUR-Lex - C/2023/01262 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide\" target=\"_blank\">The Erasmus+ Programme Guide | Erasmus+ (europa.eu)</a></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#00B050;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-GB\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b>2.&nbsp;</b><b>Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</b> as described in the Call document.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AC_202301262\" target=\"_blank\">EUR-Lex - C/2023/01262 - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu)</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide\" target=\"_blank\">The Erasmus+ Programme Guide | Erasmus+ (europa.eu)</a></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp;Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"ui-provider ee bqd bgf bqe bqf bqg bqh bqi bqj bqk bql bqm bqn bqo bqp bqq bqr bqs bqt bqu bqv bqw bqx bqy bqz bra brb brc brd bre brf brg brh bri brj\" dir=\"ltr\">Page limit for Part B in this call is 70 pages.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> </span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b>3.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding, and the successful transition to the labor market. Building on the success of the programme in the 2014-2020 period, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the number of opportunities offered to even more participants and to a wider range of organizations, focusing on the qualitative impact of the Programme and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener, and digitally fit societies.</p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences necessary in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24).</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensure swift recovery from crises, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.</p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, young people in particular, to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2024, the Programme will also continue the effort to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analysis, is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills, and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills, and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organizations, and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity, and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.</p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters, as well as their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant or face difficulties in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future.</p><p>This objective can also be achieved through non-formal learning activities, which aim to enhance the skills and competences of young people and adult learners, as well as their active citizenship. The programme can contribute to enhance the development of social and intercultural competences, critical thinking and media literacy, and thus to prevent and counter disinformation and fake news.</p><p>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making its economy sustainable, Erasmus+ projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organizations and participants involved should have an environment-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done to make projects more sustainable on their level, and help them come up with greener ways of implementing their activities.</p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organizations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving, and recognizing competences acquired through formal, informal, and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas, the transmission of best practices and expertise, and the development of digital capabilities. This contributes to a high-quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 35 years of European programmes in the fields of education and training, youth and sport, covering both the intra-European and the international partnerships dimension.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "May 22, 2024 6:27:06 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 22, 2024 6:27:06 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><b><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#333333;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-alt:none windowtext 0cm;&#10;padding:0cm;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\">Proposal numbers:</span></b><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&#10;color:#333333;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#333333;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-alt:none windowtext 0cm;&#10;padding:0cm;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\">Call ERASMUS-EDU-2024-VIRT-EXCH has closed on 25 April 2024. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#333333;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-alt:none windowtext 0cm;&#10;padding:0cm;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\">160 proposals have been submitted.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#333333;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-alt:none windowtext 0cm;&#10;padding:0cm;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\">Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in October 2024.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#333333;mso-ligatures:none;&#10;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jan 30, 2024 2:31:22 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jan 30, 2024 2:31:22 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;&#10;background:white\"><b><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:&quot;inherit&quot;,serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#333333;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;mso-border-alt:none windowtext 0cm;&#10;padding:0cm;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:EN-IE\">EVE 2024 -
