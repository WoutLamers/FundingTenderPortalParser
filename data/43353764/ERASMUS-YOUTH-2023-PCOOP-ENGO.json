They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension. Selected projects will be expected to share the results of their activities at local, regional, national level and transnational level.</p><p>Cooperation Partnerships are anchored to the priorities and policy frameworks of each Erasmus+ sector, both at European and national level, while aiming at producing incentives for cross-sectoral and horizontal cooperation in thematic areas.</p><p>Depending on the field of the project proposed or on the type of applicant, Cooperation Partnerships are managed either by the National Agencies or by the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).

Participating organisations and participants involved in the activities should take an active role in all those stages and thus enhancing their learning experience.</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Planning (define the needs, objectives, project and learning outcomes, activity formats, schedule etc.);</li><li>preparation (planning of the activities, development of work programme, practical arrangements, confirmation of the target group(s) of envisaged activities, set up of agreements with partners etc.);</li><li>implementation of activities;</li><li>follow-up (evaluation of the activities and their impact at different levels, sharing and use of the project's results).</li> </ul><p>Cooperation Partnerships may include the organisation of transnational learning, teaching and training activities of individuals and groups of individuals, in so far as they bring added value in the achievement of the project's objectives. The format, purpose and the type and number of participants in the proposed activities will be described and justified as part of the project application.</p><p><strong>Horizontal aspects to be considered when designing your project</strong></p><p>In addition to complying with the formal criteria and setting up sustainable cooperation arrangement with all project partners, the following elements can contribute to increasing the impact and qualitative implementation of Cooperation Partnerships throughout the different project phases. Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing Cooperation Partnership projects.</p><p>Inclusion and Diversity</p><p>The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions. To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy<a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/programme-guide/part-b/key-action-2/cooperation-partnerships#footnote5_zl388a5\">5</a> has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Cooperation partnerships are especially suitable to work on inclusion and diversity as the subject of the project, further developing inclusive and diversity-sensitive practices and methods, in accordance with the corresponding policy priority for the action. Also, independently from the thematic of their projects, organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.</p><p>Environmental sustainability</p><p>Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets. Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.</p><p>Digital dimension</p><p>Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful Cooperation Partnerships. In particular, projects in the field of school education and adult education are strongly encouraged to use European School Education Platform, (including eTwinning), or the adult learning platform EPALE to work together before, during and after the project activities. Projects in the field of youth are strongly encouraged to use the European Youth Portal and the European Youth Strategy Platform to work together before, during and after the project activities.</p><p>Participation and civic engagement</p><p>The Programme supports participation and active engagement throughout all its actions. Cooperation Partnership projects should offer opportunities for people\u2019s participation in democratic life, social and civic engagement. The focus will also be on raising awareness on and understanding the European Union context, notably as regards the common EU values, the principles of unity and diversity, as well as their cultural identity, cultural awareness and their social and historical heritage.</p><p><strong>Award criteria</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance of the project</strong> (maximum score 25 points)</p><p>The extent to which:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>the proposal is relevant for objectives and priorities of the Action.

Applicants will choose between the 3 pre-defined amounts according to the activities they want to undertake and the results they want to achieve.</p><p>When planning their projects, the applicant organisations - together with their project partners - will need to choose the single lump sum amount more appropriate to cover the costs of their projects, based on their needs and objectives. If the project is selected for funding, the requested lump sum amount becomes the overall grant amount.</p><p>Proposals must describe the activities that applicants commit to carry out with the lump sum amount requested and must satisfy the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>The choice of the lump sum amount to be requested should be based on the applicant\u2019s own estimate for the overall cost of the project. Starting from this estimate, applicants must choose the single lump sum amount that suits best their needs while ensuring an efficient use of the funds and the respect of the co-financing principle (i.e. project budgets are expected to be complemented with other funding sources, therefore the expected overall cost of the project shall be higher than the fixed lump sum amount requested).</p><p>In case of doubts between two amounts, applicants can: a) reduce the cost of their project, for instance by finding more cost-effective ways to achieve similar results or by adapting the number/scale of the project activities to the budget; b) increase the scale of their project, for instance by aiming to reaching more participants with their activities, increasing the number of activities or producing additional project outputs.</p><p>The adequacy of the number, scope and complexity of the proposed project activities to the amount requested, together with their relevance for the project objectives, will be important elements of the quality assessment, in line with the award criteria described above.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>The description of the project shall include a detailed project methodology with a clear distribution of tasks and the financial arrangements among partners, a detailed timeline with the main deliverables/results, the monitoring and control system and the tools put in place to ensure a timely implementation of the project activities.</p><p>The project methodology shall show the analysis leading to the identification of needs, the setting of objectives, the system put in place to monitor the project, a quality assurance mechanism and an evaluation strategy. As part of the evaluation strategy, applicants must identify a set of quantitative and qualitative indicators allowing to assess the contribution of the deliverables/results produced to the achievement of the project objectives.</p><p>The project description shall make a distinction between project management and work packages for implementation. Applicants must split the project activities in \u201cwork packages\u201d.</p><p>A work package is defined as a set of activities contributing to the achievement of common specific objectives.</p><p>The link to specific objectives and deliverables shall be clearly described for each work package. Applicants are recommended to split their projects in a maximum of 5 work packages, including the one on project management. The project management work package is intended to cover the horizontal activities that are necessary for the implementation of the project, such as monitoring, coordination, communication, evaluation and risk management. The portion of the lump sum allocated to project management shall be maximum 20% of the total.</p><p>The assessment of these requirements shall follow the principle of proportionality: the higher the amount requested, the more the project methodology will be expected to be accurate and comprehensive.</p><p>Subcontracting of services is allowed as long as it does not cover core activities on which the achievement of the objectives of the action directly depends.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24). </p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, , including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine. </p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 5, 2023 6:53:31 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 5, 2023 6:53:31 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;&#10;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;text-transform:&#10;uppercase\">EVALUATION results <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height: normal;
