Key Action 3 provides support to policy cooperation at European Union level, thereby contributing to the implementation of existing policies and the development of new policies, which can trigger modernisation and reforms, at European Union, and systems' level, in the fields of education, training youth and sport.</p><p>European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, to be run in close cooperation with young people from across Europe (EU Member States and third countries associated to the programme). The networks should organise exchanges, promote trainings (for instance for youth leaders) and allow for young people themselves to set up joint projects, all of which can be done through both physical and online activities.</p><p><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</strong></p><p>European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting regional partnerships, enabling young people across Europe to set up joint projects, organise exchanges and promote trainings (e.g. for youth leaders) through both physical and online activities. The action will support transnational partnerships for youth organisations from grassroots level to large-scale partnerships, aiming to reinforce the European dimension of their activities, including on how to live better together and helping to design sustainable future ways of living, in line with the European Green Deal and the <a href=\"http://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/\">New European Bauhaus initiative</a> .</p><p>Important thematic priorities are working with and promoting the EU Youth Goals and, in general, the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:42018Y1218(01)&amp;from=EN\">EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027</a>. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_5542\">President von der Leyen Commission\u2019s political guidelines</a>. Project proposals may also treat the themes of the \u2018Conference for the Future of Europe\u2019. The European Parliament elections in 2024 are relevant in the context of this action.</p><p>Young people and youth organisations are key actors in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness, and how to improve quality of life after the pandemic, which concur with challenges related to digital skills and sustainable green lifestyles.</p><p><strong>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</strong></p><p>The action seeks to specifically support:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>The promotion and development of more transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic participation of all against a backdrop of the backlashes on socio-economic structures and in line with the EU Youth Strategy, the EU Youth Goals and the Youth Dialogue.</li><li>The implementation of EU Frameworks and initiatives such as country specific recommendations from the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester_en\">European Semester</a> as far as they relate to the youth area.</li><li>Youth organisations involved in initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcase commonalities among young Europeans and encourage discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations. This includes organising events as a lead-up to the 2024 elections to the European Parliament.</li><li>The promotion of participation of under-represented groups of young people in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations by engaging vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth;</li><li>New ways to empower youth organisations in dealing with the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, by supporting innovative ways of cooperation and network creation, development and management. Indicatively, this could include enhancing collaboration between youth organisations in a digital context through non-formal learning methods and organisational models such as alternative modes of exchanges and mutual aid.</li><li>The reinforcement of the European dimension of the activities of youth organisations, including activities on how to live better together after the pandemic and helping to design sustainable future ways of living transnationally.</li> </ul><p><strong>ACTIVITIES</strong></p><p>The action targets NGOs (not for profit) and public bodies, which propose projects with a capacity to mobilise young people in partnerships covering different countries and regions within the EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme.</p><p>Mobility activities for young people should form a key component of European Youth Together projects. This mobility should offer cross-border exchanges and non-formal or informal training opportunities for young people from across Europe (East, West, North and South) that can be prepared and supported through online fora to contribute to the objectives of this action. These mobility activities must be very clearly justified according to the objectives of the action.</p><p>All the activities should contribute to broadening the outreach towards youth, reaching young people both within and beyond youth organisations including youth with fewer opportunities, to ensure a diversity of voices is heard.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Eligible countries</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">:&nbsp;as described in the Call document.</span><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The <a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Erasmus+ Programme Guide 2023</a>&nbsp;is available in all official EU languages&nbsp;(see PDF versions).<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:9.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;&#10;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#00B050;mso-fareast-language:&#10;EN-GB\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Eligibility and admissibility conditions:</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"> as described in the Call document.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-programme-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Erasmus+ Programme Guide 2023</a>&nbsp;is available in all official EU languages&nbsp;(see PDF versions).</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-IE\">Character and page limits:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-IE\">- page limit: 70 pages.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies.</p><p>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one\u2019s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24).</p><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.</p><p>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. In 2023, the Programme will also continue to mobilise its efforts to mitigate the socio-economic and educational consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, , including by supporting projects that promote educational activities and facilitate the integration of people fleeing the war in Ukraine into their new learning environments, as well as activities supporting organisations, learners and staff in Ukraine.</p><p>Furthermore, in line with the objectives of the European Innovation Agenda on supporting talent development for boosting Europe\u2019s innovation capacity, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.</p><p>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship. In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities.</p><p>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion. The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jul 27, 2023 1:35:36 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jul 27, 2023 1:35:36 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p
