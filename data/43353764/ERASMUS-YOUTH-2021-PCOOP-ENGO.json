They aim to support the development, transfer and/or implementation of innovative practices as well as the implementation of joint initiatives promoting cooperation, peer learning and exchanges of experience at European level. Results should be re-usable, transferable, up-scalable and, if possible, have a strong transdisciplinary dimension. Selected projects will be expected to share the results of their activities at local, regional, national level and transnational level. Cooperation Partnerships are anchored to the priorities and policy frameworks of each Erasmus+ sector, both at European and national level, while aiming at producing incentives for cross-sectoral and horizontal cooperation in thematic areas.</p><p><u><strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</strong></u></p><p>Cooperation Partnerships aim at:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increasing quality in the work, activities and practices of organisations and institutions involved, opening up to new actors, not naturally included within one sector;</li><li>Building capacity of organisations to work transnationally and across sectors;</li><li>Addressing common needs and priorities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport;</li><li>Enabling transformation and change (at individual, organisational or sectoral level), leading to improvements and new approaches, in proportion to the context of each organisation;</li> </ul><p><u><strong>SECTOR SPECIFIC PRIORITIES</strong></u></p><p><strong>In the field of youth</strong>, priority will be given to actions that contribute to the core areas of the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027: engage, connect and empower young people. A particular focus will be on strengthening cross-sectorial cooperation that allows for greater synergies across different areas of actions that matter for young people, promoting youth participation in various scales and formats and supporting active citizenship of young people, notably youth at risk of social exclusion.<br>Specific priorities for the youth field include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Promoting active citizenship, young people\u2019s sense of initiative and youth entrepreneurship including social entrepreneurship: The priority aims to foster active citizenship among young people, notably through volunteering and acts of solidarity, and thereby strengthen young people's sense of initiative, particularly in the social field, and support their communities. Projects under this priority could also promote entrepreneurship, creative learning and social entrepreneurship among youth. Intercultural dialogue, knowledge and recognition of diversity and promotion of tolerance are key to this priority.</li><li>Increasing quality, innovation and recognition of youth work: The priority aims to promote the recognition and validation of youth work and informal and non-formal learning on all levels, and support quality development and innovation in youth work. This includes capacity-building of youth workers in their online and offline practices, as well as support to the development and sharing of methods to reach marginalised young people, prevent racism and intolerance among youth, and the risks, opportunities and implications of digitalisation.</li><li>Strengthening the employability of young people: The priority aims to strengthen young people\u2019s key competences and basic skills. The youth sector plays an important role in easing the transition of young people from youth to adulthood, including supporting their integration into the labour market. Activities focusing on the inclusion and employability of young people with fewer opportunities (including NEETs), with particular emphasis on young people at risk of marginalisation and those with a migrant background, are at the core of this priority.</li><li>Reinforcing links between policy, research and practice: This priority addresses the need for stronger links between policy, research and practice in the youth field to provide improved evidence of needs and facilitate policy making. Activities to promote better knowledge about the situation of young people and youth policies in Europe and beyond will be of importance to this priority.</li> </ul><p><strong>WHICH ARE THE CRITERIA TO BE MET TO APPLY FOR A COOPERATION PARTNERSHIP?</strong></p><p>In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Cooperation Partnerships must comply with the following criteria:</p><p><u><strong>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</strong></u></p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td><strong>Who can apply?</strong></td>    <td>Any participating organisation established in a Programme Country can be the applicant.

Applicants are encouraged to take these opportunities and dimensions into account when designing Cooperation Partnership projects.</p><p><strong>Environmental sustainability</strong></p><p>Projects should be designed in an eco-friendly way and should incorporate green practices in all its facets. Organisations and participants should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing the project, which will encourage everyone involved in the project to discuss and learn about environmental issues, reflecting about what can be done at different levels and help organisations and participants come up with alternative, greener ways of implementing project activities.</p><p><strong>Inclusion and Diversity</strong></p><p>The Erasmus+ Programme seeks to promote equal opportunities and access, inclusion and fairness across all its actions. To implement these principles, an Inclusion and Diversity Strategy has been devised to support a better outreach to participants from more diverse backgrounds, in particular those with fewer opportunities facing obstacles to participate in European Projects. Organisations should design accessible and inclusive project activities, taking into account the views of participants with fewer opportunities and involving them in decision making throughout the whole process.</p><p><strong>Digital dimension</strong></p><p>Virtual cooperation and experimentation with virtual and blended learning opportunities are key to successful Cooperation Partnerships. Projects in the field of youth are strongly encouraged to use the European Youth Portal and the European Youth Strategy Platform to work together before, during and after the project activities.</p><p><u><strong>AWARD CRITERIA</strong></u></p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p><strong>Relevance of the project</strong></p> <p><strong>(maximum score 30 points)</strong></p> </td>    <td> <p>The extent to which:</p>     <ul level=\"0\"><li>the proposal is relevant for objectives and priorities of the Action.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones\u2019 mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union<span> </span></span></span><span><span>Workplan</span></span><span><span><span> </span>for Sport. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds.<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</span></strong><span><span><span> </span>In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its<span> </span></span></span><span><span>participants,</span></span><span><span><span> </span>in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Furthermore,<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>developing digital<span> </span></span></strong><strong><span>skills and competences</span></strong><strong><span><span> </span>and skills in forward-looking fields</span></strong><span><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion.<span> </span></span></span><span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span></span><span><span><span> </span>This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span></span><span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><strong><span>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</span></strong><span><span><span> </span>for the European Union's future.<span> </span></span></span><span><span>This issue<span> </span></span></span><span><span>can also be targeted</span></span><span><span><span> </span>through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy,<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>projects<span> </span></span></strong><strong><span>should be designed</span></strong><strong><span><span> </span>in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</span></strong><span><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them<span> </span></span></span><span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion.</span></span><span><span><span> </span>The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Dec 16, 2021 5:47:05 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 16, 2021 5:47:05 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Published&nbsp;: 20/04/2021<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Deadline&nbsp;: 15/06/2021<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Available budget&nbsp;: EUR 5.000.000, 00<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The results of the evaluation are as follows&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Number of proposals <strong>submitted&nbsp;</strong>: <strong>18</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of <strong>inadmissible </strong>proposals&nbsp;:<strong> 0</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of <strong>withdrawn</strong> proposals&nbsp;: <strong>1</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-indent:35.4pt\">&nbsp;Number of <strong>ineligible </strong>proposals&nbsp;:<strong> 7</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of <strong>above threshold</strong> proposals&nbsp;: <strong>10</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Total budget requested</strong> for the above threshold proposals&nbsp;: <strong>EUR 3.570.000, 00</strong><o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>We informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals on 29/11/2021.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>For questions, please contact&nbsp;: <span lang=\"ES\"><a href=\"mailto:EACEA-YOUTH@ec.europa.eu\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;color:black;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:&#10;black;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB\">EACEA-YOUTH@ec.europa.eu</span></a></span><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Jun 25, 2021 3:24:26 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 25, 2021 3:24:26 PM", "content": "<p>Call&nbsp; ERASMUS-YOUTH-2021-PCOOP-ENGO has closed on the 15 June 2021.</p>\r\n<p><strong>18 proposals</strong> have been submitted.</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in November 2021.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "May 6, 2021 5:54:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "May 6, 2021 5:54:20 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ERASMUS-YOUTH-2021-PCOOP-ENGO(ERASMUS-LS)"}, {"approvalDate": "May 4, 2021 11:45:17 AM", "lastChangeDate": "May 4, 2021 11:45:17 AM", "content": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Due to technical issues, the submission deadlines for&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">Cooperation partnerships submitted by European NGOs in the field of youth (Call ID: ERASMUS-YOUTH-2021-PCOOP-ENGO)</span><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;managed by the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) has been postponed to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\">15 June, 17.00 Brussels time</span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 23, 2021 6:40:44 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 23, 2021 6:40:44 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ERASMUS-YOUTH-2021-PCOOP-ENGO(ERASMUS-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
