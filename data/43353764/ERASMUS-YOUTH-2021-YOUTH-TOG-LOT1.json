The purpose is to encourage new applications from organisations not well established yet at European level. To this end, the action primarily consists in supporting activities aiming at connecting EU level youth organisations and grassroots NGOs operating at local levels (rural, cities, regions, countries) that will benefit from developing cross-border activities.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The overall structure of the action takes into account the growing size of the youth sector, the changing trends in youth participation and the need for more sustained and stable funding support in the youth domain</span></span><span><span>161</span></span><span><span>. It also takes into account the need to better cover the great diversity of youth organisations across Europe and to respond to the identified needs for both grassroots activities and large co-operation projects within Europe.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span><span>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION</span></span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>European Youth Together projects aim to create networks promoting cross-border partnerships that will run in close cooperation with young people from across Europe (Erasmus+ programme countries). These networks will organise cooperation, exchanges, promote trainings (for instance for youth leaders) and allow young people themselves to set up joint projects through physical and/or online activities.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Contributing to and promoting the EU Youth Goals as well as the EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027</span></span><span><span>162 </span></span><span><span>constitute important thematic priorities for the action. The European Youth Goals are also reflected in the President von der Leyen Commission\u2019s political guidelines</span></span><span><span>163</span></span><span><span>. The ongoing 18 months\u2019 cycle</span></span><span><span>164 </span></span><span><span>of the Youth Dialogue and its priorities is equally a basis for this European Youth Together action.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Finally, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, responses are required to mitigate its socio-economic impact on youth, including capacity building and specific measures to deal with Covid-19 crisis recovery in the youth sector. When doing so, youth networks should consider ways of forging solidarity and inclusiveness, which concur with challenges related to digital skills and green lifestyles.</span></span></p><p><strong><span><span><span>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</span></span></span></strong></p><p><span><span>The action seeks to specifically support:</span></span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span><span>The promotion and development of transnational structured cooperation, online and offline, between different youth organisations so as to build or strengthen partnerships focusing on solidarity and inclusive democratic </span></span><span><span>participation of all; </span></span></li><li><span><span>The implementation of EU Frameworks and initiatives such as country specific recommendations from the European Semester</span></span><span><span>165 </span></span><span><span>as far as they relate to the youth area;</span></span></li><li><span><span>Initiatives to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and in society by organising trainings, showcase commonalities among young Europeans and encourage discussion and debate on their connection to the EU, its values and democratic foundations, including by providing a meaningful voice to youth in the framework of the Covid-19 recovery process;</span></span></li><li><span><span>The participation of under-represented groups of young people (e.g. vulnerable and socio-economic disadvantaged youth) in politics, youth organisations and other civil society organisations;</span></span></li><li><span><span>New ways to empower youth organisations in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones\u2019 mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union </span><span>Workplan</span><span> for Sport. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. </span><strong>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</strong><span> In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its </span><span>participants,</span><span> in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>Furthermore, </span><strong>developing digital </strong><strong>skills and competences</strong><strong> and skills in forward-looking fields</strong><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. </span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span> This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span><span> </span><strong>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</strong><span> for the European Union's future. </span><span>This issue </span><span>can also be targeted</span><span> through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, </span><strong>projects </strong><strong>should be designed</strong><strong> in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</strong><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them </span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span> The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span><span> </span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Dec 16, 2021 6:03:25 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 16, 2021 6:03:25 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"background-image: initial;
