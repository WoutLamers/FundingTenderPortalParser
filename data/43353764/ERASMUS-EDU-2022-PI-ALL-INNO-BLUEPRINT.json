Also, the transition to a circular and greener economy needs to be underpinned by changes to qualifications and national education and training curricula to meet emerging professional needs for <strong>green skills</strong> and sustainable development.</p><p>Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills aim to create new strategic approaches and cooperation for concrete skills development solutions \u2013 both in the short and the medium term \u2013 in given economic sectors, or in areas implementing a major action of the European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, the<strong> Pact for Skills</strong>. The main objective of the Pact is to mobilise and incentivize all relevant stakeholders to take concrete actions for the upskilling and reskilling of the workforce, by pooling efforts and setting up partnerships, also at EU level addressing the needs of the labour market, supporting green and digital transitions as well as national, regional and local skills and growth strategies. Therefore, the deliverables of Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills, i.e. sectoral skills intelligence, skills strategies, occupational profiles, training programmes, and long-term planning, will be an important contribution to the work of the sectoral partnerships that have joined the Pact for Skills.</p><p>Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills seek to tackle skills gaps on the labour market that hamper growth, innovation and competitiveness in specific sectors or areas, aiming both at short term interventions and long term strategies. These Alliances will be implemented in the 14 industrial ecosystems identified in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe <em>(COM/2020/102 final: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0102</em>) (see eligibility criteria).</p><p>The Pact for Skills builds on and absorbs the Blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills. Therefore, Alliances under Lot 2 will support the implementation of the Pact by developing a sectoral skills strategy. This strategy has to lead to systemic and structural impact on reducing skills shortages, gaps and mismatches, as well as ensuring appropriate quality and levels of skills. The sectoral skills strategy must include a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined objectives with the goal to match demand and supply of skills to support the overall sector-specific growth strategy. The Alliances aim to build the base for the Pact for Skills and define the pathway that should be continued after the project is finalised.</p><p>Drawing on evidence regarding skills needs with regard to occupational profiles, Blueprint Alliances support the design and delivery of transnational education &amp; training content, as well as teaching and training methodologies, for quick take-up at regional and local level and for new occupations that are emerging.</p><p>Proposals should include the design of continuing vocational training programmes to address urgent skills needs of people in working age. Proposals should also include developments of emerging occupational profiles, related qualifications, which should cover upper and post-secondary VET levels (EQF levels 3 to 5) and tertiary levels (EQF levels 6 to 8). Furthermore, proposals should include the design of related core curricula and education and training programmes leading to those qualifications.</p><p>Each project must include among its partners both vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) organisations and labour market actors. Ideally they also involve policy bodies, certifying bodies as well as European sectoral associations and representatives of industry.</p><p><strong>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA</strong></p><p>In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Lot 2 - Alliances for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills (implementing the \u201cBlueprint\u201d) must comply with the following criteria:</p><p><strong>Who can submit an application?</strong></p><p>Any full partner legally established in an <strong>EU Member State or third country associated to the Programme</strong> can be the applicant.

Depending on its use hydrogen is a major enabler in the following ecosystems: Mobility/transport/automotive; Renewable energy; Energy-intensive industries; Construction; Aerospace and defence. A proposal should address only one ecosystem). Only one proposal per industrial ecosystem can be selected for funding. A proposal may concern an ecosystem that is not covered by an on-going Blueprint project or an ecosystem that has already an on-going Blueprint. In the latter case, the proposal must address fields and areas that are clearly different from those addressed by the on-going Blueprint project/s (<em>https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1415&amp;langId=en</em>).</p><p><strong>Duration of project</strong><br>4 years</p><p><strong>Where to apply?</strong><br>To the European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA).</p><p>Call ID lot2: ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO-BLUEPRINT</p><p><strong>When to apply?</strong><br>Applicants have to submit their grant application <strong>by 15 September at 17:00:00 (Brussels time)</strong>.</p><p>Applicant organisations will be assessed against the relevant exclusion and selection criteria.

The project will also aim at building cooperation between large companies and micro, small and medium companies (SMEs) throughout the value chain in a particular industrial ecosystem;</li><li>Gathering skills intelligence on a continuous basis: delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format; developing a common methodology for anticipating future skills needs as well as monitoring (on a yearly basis) progress and the evolution of the demand and supply of skills based on credible foresight scenarios, drawing on the EU Skills Panorama and, where relevant, the work of the OECD, the World Economic Forum and existing Sector Skills Alliances;</li><li>Mapping of existing upskilling and reskilling support available in the sector/ecosystem (provided by industry, public and private stakeholders) and identifying which of those actions could be upscaled to support companies in the value chains;</li><li>Based on the skills intelligence, developing a skills strategy for the industrial ecosystem including priorities for actions to support the objectives of re- and upskilling the workforce of the industrial ecosystem and those who could join the sector (e.g. economically inactive). The strategy should detail how major trends, such as global, societal, and technological developments in the industrial ecosystem, are likely to affect jobs and skills needs. It should describe the expected timeline and give particular attention to the impact of digital and key enabling technologies. It should identify and define occupations and related skills that are likely to emerge in the sector (i.e. will be completely new). It should also identify key industrial players and stakeholders that should be involved in the implementation of the strategy. This strategy should be the one of the first key deliverable of the project, indicating a clear set of activities, milestones and well-defined outputs, as well as setting out concrete priority actions suggesting how to match future demand and supply of skills for these emerging occupations. The strategy should be used as a base for building the partnership under the Pact for Skills;</li><li>Where relevant, ensuring that results of the project are available in open data format so that they can feed into the EU Skills Panorama and the European Skills, Competencies, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO);</li><li>Delivering relevant EU and country and/or regional level qualitative evidence and quantitative data according to linked open data format.</li> </ul><p><strong>Designing European sector-wide agreed \u2018core\u2019 curricula and training programmes</strong></p><p><em><strong>Within the first year of activity (reactive response)</strong></em></p><p>In parallel to the actions above, all projects should rapidly <strong>address urgent skills needs in occupations in an industrial<br>ecosystem resulting from the Covid-19 crisis and the digital and green transition</strong> (evidence to be provided in the proposal):</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Drawing on, where available, the occupational profiles of the Classification of ESCO and existing competence frameworks (<em>E.g. the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens, the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework and the European e-Competence Framework (e-CF)</em>);</li><li>Designing continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling and re-skilling the labour force by innovative blended and work-based learning;</li><li>Ensuring the good quality of the content and provision of the new training programmes by applying quality assurance methods in line with EQAVET and ESG (European Standards &amp; Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Higher Education);</li><li>Ensuring rapid uptake and use of the training programmes by reaching out to main players in value chains within the industrial ecosystem, to Centres of Vocational Excellence (<em>https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1501</em>), to regions implementing smart specialisation strategies (<em>https://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home</em>), to European Cluster Partnerships (<em>https://www.clustercollaboration.eu</em>) and to Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Technology (EIT) (<em>https://eit.europa.eu/</em>) that are active in the same industrial ecosystem.</li> </ul><p><strong><em>Throughout the project (proactive response).</em></strong></p><p>Projects should then work on <strong>developing training content for emerging occupational profiles</strong>:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>On the basis of identified skills needs for emerging occupational profiles in an industrial ecosystem given economic sector, designing new modular VET curricula and related qualifications for initial education &amp; training (E&amp;T) (full curricula for integration in national education &amp; training systems), and continuing vocational training programmes for up-skilling or re-skilling the people of working age (modules addressing emerging skills needs);</li><li>These curricula and training programmes shall be composed of units of learning outcomes, in line with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) / National Qualifications Frameworks (NQFs) and informed by ESCO; curricula should deliver job-specific skills as well as key competences (<em>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2018.189.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:C:2018:189:TOC</em>), that include notably transversal skills and STEAM disciplines (<em>Science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics</em>);</li><li>Integrating periods of work-based learning into the new training content, including opportunities to apply knowledge in practical \"real life\" workplace situations, and embedding trans-national learning experience whenever possible;</li><li>Applying quality management to the new training content either by applying the quality assurance principles of EQAVET and ESG or by using already existing quality assurance systems which, however, should be in line with EQAVET and ESG;</li><li>Promoting relevant sectoral qualifications including trans-national joint programmes awarded by more than one E&amp;T provider, thus facilitating cross-border certification, and building mutual trust, contributing to increased learner and professional mobility in the sector.</li> </ul><p><strong>Delivering the \u2018core\u2019 curricula and training programmes</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Developing delivery methodologies for the curricula and training programmes, that are adapted to the various target groups, using innovative approaches to teaching and learning, including the provision of work-based learning, the use of ICTs (e.g. blended learning, simulators, augmented reality, etc.), virtual/blended mobility solutions for learners and staff, and open educational resources (e.g. AI-enhanced learning, MOOC\u00b4s (<em>MOOC is a Massive Open Online Course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web.

They will considerably strengthen the synergies between both educational fields in fostering innovation, new skills, a sense of initiative and entrepreneurial mind-sets. These Alliances among HE, VET and the enterprises are expected to contribute to the development of regional eco-systems and directly provide a valuable input to the economy, integrating workbased learning. While universities have research knowledge and data that allows them to directly provide input to small and medium sized enterprises to boost local economies, VET providers supply skills needed by enterprises and they are able to foster growth in the local economy.</p><p>At a larger scale, Alliances for Innovation are expected to target societal and economic challenges, both in education and employment, and take into account key areas such as innovation challenges, skills provision, climate change, green economy, demography, digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Benefits can also be drawn from cooperation with large enterprises. The Alliances for Innovation will focus on the need of citizens and accelerate the modernization of HE and VET.</p><p>The Pact for Skills will not only establish a framework for the implementation of the other actions of the updated Skills Agenda, but also for the dissemination and exploitation of the project results of the Alliances for Innovation. In particular the results of the Blueprint Alliances for sectoral cooperation on skills will be used as a basis for the Pact for Skills sectoral large-scale partnerships.</p><p>In addition, the Alliances will help to implement the EU Communication on the Renewed Agenda for Higher Education (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017DC0247) and contribute to the creation of a European Education Area (https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/european-education-area_en). They will also contribute to implement the EU Industrial and SMEs strategies (2021).</p><p>The Alliances for Innovation will also take into account the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and the Paris Declaration on Climate Change (https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) as overarching parameters of the action, thus helping the European Commission to implement its new Green Deal (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/european-green-deal-communication_en.pdf) and the Europe Recovery Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en). The Alliances will also contribute ideas to the New European Bauhaus initiative (https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en) which aims to design new sustainable ways of living to meet the objectives of the Green Deal.</p><p>Alliances for Innovation are meant to have a short and long term impact on the wider range of stakeholders involved, at individual, organisational and systemic level. This impact is expected to go beyond the project's lifetime and beyond the organisations involved in the partnerships. It is expected that partnership and activities persist. For that, results/deliverables might not be stand-alone but be linked to/integrated into existing undertakings, schemes, projects, platforms, ventures etc.</p><p><strong>AWARD CRITERIA</strong></p><p><strong>Relevance of the project (maximum score 25 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Link to EU policy and initiatives</strong>: the proposal takes into account and contributes to achieving the European objectives in the field of HE and VET and sectoral EU policies relevant for chosen industrial ecosystem, contributes to the Pact for Skills and the European Skills Agenda and takes into account EU tools. A proposal addressing an industrial ecosystem in which a Blueprint Alliance is already ongoing in that ecosystem must clearly be complementary, i.e. cover a clearly different field, and must specify what results of ongoing Blueprint project/s it will build on; there must not be any overlaps in scope, outputs and activities. At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem that is not covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be more relevant than a proposal covering a part of an ecosystem where a Blueprint is already ongoing;</li><li><strong>Purpose</strong>: the proposal is relevant to the objectives and activities of the Action. In particular, the proposal includes developments on a highly relevant set of emerging occupational profiles, and designs the related qualifications, organised in units of learning outcomes, at both, EQF levels 3 to 5 and EQF levels 6 to 8. The proposal includes the design, test and initial provision of the related education and training programmes, conceived and delivered as modular, flexible, accessible learning opportunities, taking into account the validation of previously acquired skills;</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: the objectives are based on a sound needs analysis; they are clearly defined, realistic and address issues relevant to the participating organisations and to the action;</li><li><strong>Innovation:</strong> the proposal considers state-of-the-art methods and techniques, and leads to innovative results and solutions;</li><li><strong>European added value</strong>: the proposal demonstrates clearly the added value generated through its transnationality;</li><li><strong>Education &amp; training representation</strong>: the Alliance includes partners that adequately represent education &amp; training providers;</li><li><strong>Sector/area representation</strong>: the Alliance includes partners that adequately represent the industrial ecosystem concerned;</li><li><strong>Digital and key-enabling technologies (KETs), including Artificial Intelligence (AI) skills</strong>: extent to which the proposal addresses these skills in the project design for one, or several related occupational profiles;</li><li><strong>Green skills</strong>: the proposal integrates skills linked to the transition to a circular and greener economy in the training content for one, or several related occupational profiles.</li> </ul><p><strong>Quality of the project design and implementation (maximum score 30 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Coherence</strong>: The proposal presents a coherent and comprehensive set of appropriate, concrete and practical activities to meet the identified needs and lead to the expected results;</li><li><strong>Structure</strong>: the work programme is clear and intelligible, and covers all phases (preparation, implementation, exploitation, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination);</li><li><strong>Methodology</strong>: the proposal makes use of EU instruments and tools related to skills and occupations whenever relevant, such as EQF, ESCO, Europass, EQAVET, ESG;</li><li><strong>Management</strong>: solid management arrangements are foreseen. Timelines, organisation, tasks and responsibilities are well defined and realistic. The proposal allocates appropriate resources to each activity;</li><li><strong>Work plan</strong>: quality and effectiveness of the work plan, including the extent to which the resources assigned to work packages are in line with their objectives and deliverables;</li><li><strong>Quality of arrangements for the recognition and validation of qualifications</strong>: in line with European transparency and recognition tools and principles;</li><li><strong>Budget</strong>: the budget provides for appropriate resources necessary for success, it is neither overestimated nor underestimated and is proportionate to the scope of the proposal; a proposal for an industrial ecosystem in which a Blueprint Alliance is already ongoing is expected to submit a budget demonstrating clearly that double funding will be prevented, since it will complement and build on the work already done by the on-going Blueprint;</li><li><strong>Financial and quality control</strong>: control measures (continuous quality evaluation, expert peer reviews, benchmarking activities, etc.) and quality indicators ensure that the project implementation is of high quality and cost-efficient. Challenges/risks of the project are clearly identified and mitigating actions properly addressed. Expert review processes are planned as an integral part of the project. The Alliance work programme includes an independent external quality assessment at mid-term and at the end of the project.</li> </ul><p><strong>Quality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements (maximum score 25 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Configuration</strong>: the composition of the partnership is in line with the action and project objectives; it brings together an appropriate mix of relevant organisations, including vocational education and training, higher education and industry, including SMEs, with the necessary profiles, skills, experience, expertise and management support required for successful implementation of the project. The Alliance ensures adequate representativeness of the industrial ecosystem: the representativeness and expertise of the partners in the industrial ecosystem concerned and at national and European level is convincingly demonstrated. The participation of European social partners and/or national social partners in the countries covered by the Alliance is highly relevant. The geographical spread and representativeness of relevant partners over the Programme Countries and regions involved in the Alliance should be such that the Alliance has high implementation capacity in the countries and regions covered (e.g. through the participation of a European sector organisation and/or European social partners);</li><li><strong>Commitment</strong>: the contributions from partners are significant, pertinent and complementary; the distribution of responsibilities and tasks is clear, appropriate, and demonstrates the commitment and active contribution of all participating organisations in relation to their specific expertise and capacity;</li><li><strong>Tasks</strong>: the coordinator shows high quality management and coordination of transnational networks and leadership in complex environment. Individual tasks are allocated on the basis of the specific know-how of each partner;</li><li><strong>Collaboration/Team spirit</strong>: an effective mechanism is proposed to ensure a good coordination, decision-making and communication between the participating organisations, participants and any other relevant stakeholder;</li><li><strong>Reward</strong>: the Alliance provides clear added value and benefits to each partner organisation;</li><li><strong>Involvement of third countries not associated to the Programme: </strong>if applicable, the involvement of participating organisations from third countries not associated to the Programme brings an essential added value to the Alliance.</li> </ul><p><strong>Impact (maximum score 20 points)</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Exploitation</strong>: the proposal demonstrates how the outcomes of the Alliance will be rolled out in the participating countries in line with the objectives of the Pact for Skills;</li><li><strong>Dissemination</strong>: the proposal provides a clear plan for the dissemination of results, and includes appropriate activities and their timing, tools and channels to ensure that the results and benefits will be spread effectively to stakeholders;</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>: the proposal shows societal and economic relevance and outreach. It ensures an impact at local, national and European level on the target groups and relevant stakeholders with a significant role in the sector concerned including in education and training, such as those that have joined the Pact for Skills. It includes measures as well as targets and indicators to monitor progress and assess the expected impact (short-and long-term);</li><li><strong>Open access</strong>: if relevant, the proposal describes how the materials, documents and media produced will be made freely available and promoted through open licenses and in linked open data format, and does not contain disproportionate limitations;</li><li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: the proposal explains how the action plan for the roll-out at national and regional levels will be developed. The proposal includes appropriate measures and the identification of financial resources (European, national and private) to ensure that the results and benefits achieved by the Alliance will be sustained beyond the project lifetime.</li> </ul><p><strong>Only 1 proposal per ecosystem can be funded.</strong></p><p>To be considered for funding, proposals must score at least <strong>70 points</strong> taking into account the necessary minimum pass score for each of the four award criteria: minimum 13 points for the \u201crelevance of the project\u201d category; 16 points for \u201cquality of the project design and implementation\u201d, 13 points for \u201cquality of the partnership and the cooperation arrangements\u201d and 11 points for \u201cimpact\u201d.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE FUNDING RULES?</strong></p><p>This action follows a lump sum funding model. The amount of the single lump sum contribution will be determined for each grant based on the estimated budget of the action proposed by the applicant. The granting authority will fix the lump sum of each grant based on the proposal, evaluation result, funding rates and the maximum grant amount set in the call.</p><p><strong>The maximum EU grant</strong> per project is as follows:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>4 million euros (4 years</strong> project) - only one proposal per industrial ecosystem can be selected for funding.</li> </ul><p>At equal quality, a proposal covering an ecosystem that is not at all covered by an ongoing Blueprint Alliance will be assessed as more relevant.</p><p><strong><u>How is the project lump sum determined?</u></strong></p><p>Applicants must fill in a detailed budget table according to the application form, taking into account the following<br>points:<br>a) The budget should be detailed as necessary by beneficiary/-ies and organized in coherent work packages (for example divided into \u2018project management\u2019, \u2018training\u2019, \u2018organization of events\u2019, \u2018mobility preparation and implementation\u2019, \u2018communication and dissemination\u2019, \u2018quality assurance\u2019, etc.);</p><p>b) The proposal must describe the activities covered by each work package;</p><p>c) Applicants must provide in their proposal a breakdown of the estimated costs showing the share per work package (and, within each work package, the share assigned to each beneficiary and affiliated entity);</p><p>d) Costs described can cover staff costs, travel and subsistence costs, equipment costs and subcontracting as well as other costs (such us dissemination of information, publishing or translation).</p><p>Proposals will be evaluated according to the standard evaluation procedures with the help of internal and/or external experts. The experts will assess the quality of the proposals against the requirements defined in the call and the expected impact, quality and efficiency of the action. The lump sum value will be limited to a maximum of 80% of the estimated budget determined after evaluation.</p><p>Following the proposal evaluation, the authorising officer will establish the amount of the lump sum, taking into account the findings of the assessment carried out.</p><p>The grant parameters (maximum grant amount, funding rate, total eligible costs, etc.) will be fixed in the Grant Agreement.</p><p>The project achievements will be evaluated on the outcomes completed. The funding scheme would allow putting focus on the outputs rather than the inputs, thereby placing emphasis on the quality and level of achievement of measurable objectives.</p><p>More details are described in the model Grant Agreement available in the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal (FTOP).</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt;

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones\u2019 mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union<span> </span></span><span>Workplan</span><span><span> </span>for Sport</span><span><span> </span>(2021-2024)</span><span>. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds.<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</span></strong><span><span><span> </span>In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its<span> </span></span><span>participants,</span><span><span> </span>in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Furthermore,<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>developing digital<span> </span></span><span>skills and competences</span><span><span> </span>and skills in forward-looking fields</span></strong><span><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion.<span> </span></span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span><span> </span>This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society<span> </span></span><span>as a whole by</span><span><span> </span>contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span><span><span> </span></span></span><strong><span>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</span></strong><span><span><span> </span>for the European Union's future.<span> </span></span><span>This issue<span> </span></span><span>can also be targeted</span><span><span> </span>through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy,<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>projects<span> </span></span><span>should be designed</span><span><span> </span>in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</span></strong><span><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them<span> </span></span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a<span> </span></span><span>high quality</span><span><span> </span>education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span><span> </span>The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span></span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 14, 2023 12:39:48 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 14, 2023 12:39:48 PM", "content": "<div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-IE\">EVALUATION results&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-IE\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Deadline: 15/9/2022<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Available budget:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO-EDU-ENTERP: EUR 34.149.066,00<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO-BLUEPRINT: EUR 27.850.934,00&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">The results of the evaluation are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO-EDU-ENTERP<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of proposals submitted: 372<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of inadmissible proposals: 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of ineligible proposals: 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of above-threshold proposals: 149<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Total budget requested for above-threshold proposals: EUR 195.768.560,61<br />\r\n<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />\r\n<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO-BLUEPRINT<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of proposals submitted: 34<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of inadmissible proposals: 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of ineligible proposals: 1<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Number of above-threshold proposals: 10<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">Total budget requested for above-threshold proposals: EUR 39.646.013,00<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-IE\">For questions, please contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:EACEA-EPLUS-ALLIANCES@ec.europa.eu\">EACEA-EPLUS-ALLIANCES@ec.europa.eu</a><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 20, 2022 2:57:56 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 20, 2022 2:57:56 PM", "content": "<div>Call ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PI-ALL-INNO has closed on the 15 September 2022.</div>\r\n<div>406 proposals have been submitted.&nbsp;
