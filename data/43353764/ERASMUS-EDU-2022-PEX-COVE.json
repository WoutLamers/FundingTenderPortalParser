This plan shall be based on sustained partnerships between education and training providers and key industry stakeholders at the appropriate level. It should include the identification of appropriate governance structures, as well as plans for scalability and financial sustainability. It should also ensure the appropriate visibility and wide dissemination of the work of the platforms, including at EU and national political level and include details on how the roll-out will be implemented at European, national and/or regional levels with relevant partners. The action plan shall also indicate how EU funding opportunities (e.g. European Structural Funds, European Fund for Strategic Investment, Erasmus+, COSME, sectoral programmes), and national and regional funding (as well as private funding), can support the roll-out of the project. This should take into account national and regional smart specialisation strategies.</p><p><strong>EXPECTED IMPACT</strong></p><p>The gradual establishment and development of European platforms of Centres of Vocational Excellence is expected to increase the attractiveness of vocational education and training and to ensure that it is at the forefront of providing solutions to the challenges posed by rapidly changing skills needs.</p><p>By forming an essential part of the \u201cknowledge triangle\u201d \u2013 the close collaboration between businesses, education and research \u2013 and playing a fundamental role in providing skills to support innovation and smart specialisation, the Centres of Vocational Excellence are expected to ensure high quality skills and competences that lead to quality employment and career-long opportunities, which meet the needs of an innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy. This approach is expected to pave the way for VET to act within a more comprehensive and inclusive conceptualisation of skills provision, addressing innovation, pedagogy, social justice, life-long learning, transversal skills, organisational and continuing professional learning and community needs.</p><p>By being firmly anchored within regional/local contexts while at the same time operating at transnational level, the Centres of Vocational Excellence will form strong and enduring partnerships between the VET community and the world of work at national level and across borders. They will thereby ensure the continuous relevance of skills provision and achieve results that would be difficult to obtain without knowledge sharing and sustained cooperation.</p><p>Through the wide dissemination of project outcomes at transnational, national and/or regional levels and the development of a long term action plan for the progressive roll out of project deliverables, taking national and regional smart specialisation strategies into account, individual projects are expected to engage relevant stakeholders within and outside the participating organisations and ensure a lasting impact after the project lifetime.</p><p><strong>AWARD CRITERIA</strong></p><p>The following award criteria apply:</p><p><strong>Relevance of the project</strong> (maximum score 35 points)</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Link to policy</strong>: the proposal establishes and develops a transnational cooperation platform of Centres of Vocational Excellence, aiming to foster VET excellence; it explains how it will contribute to achieve the goals of the policy priorities covered by the Council Recommendation on VET for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience, as well as the Osnabr\u00fcck Declaration;</li><li><strong>Consistency</strong>: the extent to which the proposal is based on an adequate needs analysis; the goals are clearly defined, realistic and address issues relevant to the participating organisations and to the action;</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong>: the proposal considers state-of-the-art methods and techniques, and leads to innovative results and solutions for its field in general, or for the geographical context in which the project is implemented (e.g. content; outputs produced, working methods applied, organisations and persons involved or targeted);</li><li><strong>Regional dimension</strong>: the proposal demonstrates its integration and its contribution to regional development, innovation and smart specialisation strategies, based on the identification of local/regional needs and challenges;</li><li><strong>Cooperation and partnerships</strong>: the extent to which the proposal is suitable of realising a strong and enduring relationship at both local and transnational levels, between the VET community and businesses (can be represented by chambers or associations), in which interactions are reciprocal and mutually beneficial;</li><li><strong>European added value</strong>: the proposal clearly demonstrates the added value at the individual (learner and/or staff), institutional and systemic levels, generated through results that would be difficult to attain by the partners acting without European cooperation;</li><li><strong>Internationalisation</strong>: the proposal demonstrates its contribution to the international dimension of VET excellence, including the development of strategies to foster VET transnational mobility and sustainable partnerships;</li><li><strong>Digital skills</strong>: the extent to which the proposal foresees activities related to digital skills development (e.g. skills anticipation, innovative curricula and teaching methodologies, guidance, etc.) related to the development of digital skills;</li><li><strong>Green skills</strong>: the extent to which the proposal foresees activities (e.g. skills anticipation, innovative curricula and teaching methodologies, guidance, etc.) linked to the transition to a circular and greener economy;</li><li><strong>Social dimension:</strong> the proposal includes a horizontal concern throughout the various actions to address diversity and promote shared values, equality, including gender equality, and non-discrimination and social inclusion, including for people with special needs/fewer opportunities.</li> </ul><p><strong>Quality of the project design and implementation</strong> (maximum score 25 points)</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Coherence</strong>: the overall project design ensures consistency between project objectives, activities and the budget proposed.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones\u2019 mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union </span><span>Workplan</span><span> for Sport</span><span> (2021-2024)</span><span>. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. </span><strong>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</strong><span><span> In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its </span><span>participants,</span><span> in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Furthermore, </span><strong><span>developing digital </span><span>skills and competences</span><span> and skills in forward-looking fields</span></strong><span><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. </span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span> This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span><span> </span></span><strong>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</strong><span><span> for the European Union's future. </span><span>This issue </span><span>can also be targeted</span><span> through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, </span><strong><span>projects </span><span>should be designed</span><span> in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</span></strong><span><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them </span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a </span><span>high quality</span><span> education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span> The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span></span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 2, 2023 5:32:52 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 2, 2023 5:32:52 PM", "content": "<p><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt;&#10;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;color:#FFA53C;&#10;text-transform:uppercase;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;&#10;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">EVALUATION results</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0cm\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Published: 25/11/2021<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0cm\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Deadline: 07/09/2022<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Available budget: EUR 48 000 000</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Number of proposals submitted: 76</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Number of ineligible/inadmissuble proposals: 15</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px;\">Number of above-threshold proposals: 22</span></font></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Total budget requested for above-threshold proposals: EUR 79 868 103&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&#10;&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:&#10;EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n</span></div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><br clear=\"all\" />\r\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" />\r\n<!--[endif]-->\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt;text-align:justify;&#10;text-indent:-18.0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 8, 2022 3:05:49 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 8, 2022 3:05:49 PM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;<b><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&#10;Calibri;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:#FFA53C;text-transform:uppercase;&#10;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\">PROPOSAL NUMBERS</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\">Call ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PEX-COVE- has closed on 7 September 2022.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;tab-stops:right 16.0cm\">76 proposals have been submitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&#10;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-GB;&#10;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\">Evaluation results are expected to be communicated in February 2023</span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Feb 2, 2022 4:41:02 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 2, 2022 4:41:02 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ERASMUS-EDU-2022-PEX-COVE(ERASMUS-LS)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
