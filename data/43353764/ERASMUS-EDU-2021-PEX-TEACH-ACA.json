The Conclusions stress the benefits of mobility of teachers and the need of embedding mobility as part of teachers\u2019 initial and continuous education. Moreover, the Conclusions invite the Commission to support closer cooperation between teacher education providers within the continuum of teachers\u2019 professional development. </span></p><p><span>The 2020 Commission\u2019s Communication on Achieving the European Education Area by 2025 recognises the key role of teachers and trainers and sets the vision of having highly competent and motivated educators who can benefit from a range of support and professional development opportunities throughout their varied careers. It proposes a number of actions to address the challenges the teaching professions face today, including the plan to launch Erasmus+ Teacher Academies. </span></p><p><span>The Commission\u2019s Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) stresses the need to ensure that all teachers and trainers have the confidence and competences to use technology effectively and creatively to engage and motivate their learners as well as to ensure that all learners develop their digital competences for learning, living and working in an ever more digitalised world. </span></p><p><span>All EU countries express a desire to improve the <strong>attractiveness</strong> of the profession: in the EU countries participating in OECD\u2019s TALIS survey, on average, less than 20% of lower secondary school teachers felt that their profession is valued by the society. The <strong>ageing</strong> of the teaching professionals is a concern as upcoming waves of retirement could result in potential shortages in the teaching workforce in a country. The 2019 <strong>Education and Training Monitor</strong> indicates also that a number of European countries face <strong>serious shortages</strong> of teachers, either across the board or in some subjects such as science, or in specific profiles such as teaching pupils with special needs. </span></p><p><span>Despite wide offer of continuous professional development, <strong>teachers still self-report a lack of professional development opportunities</strong> according to the OECD\u2019s TALIS survey. Despite the benefits of <strong>mobility</strong>, it is still not embedded in teacher education effectively, due to many practical obstacles that should be removed by more consistent policies.</span></p><p><span>The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will address these issues, complement other work done in achieving the Education Area, and help transfer the results <strong>to national and regional policy making and eventually to teacher education and support for schools</strong>. They will build on the innovations and effective practice that exists within national teacher education and European cooperation and develop them further. Specific attention will be paid to dissemination and exploitation of effective practice across countries and teacher education providers, and to ensuring feedback and impact also at policy level.</span></p><p><strong><span>OBJECTIVES OF THE ACTION </span></strong></p><p><span>The overall objective of this action is to create European partnerships of teacher education and training providers to set up Erasmus+ Teacher Academies that will develop a European and international outlook in teacher education. These Academies will embrace multilingualism and cultural diversity, develop teacher education in line with the EU\u2019s priorities in education policy and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the European Education Area. </span></p><p><span>The Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will meet the following objectives: </span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Contribute to the improvement of teacher education policies and practices in Europe by creating networks and communities of practice on teacher education that bring together providers of initial teacher education (pre-service education for future teachers) and providers of continuing professional development (in-service), other relevant actors such as teacher association, ministries and stakeholders to develop and test strategies and programmes for professional learning that is effective, accessible and transferable to other contexts. </span></li><li><span>Enhance the <strong>European dimension</strong> and internationalisation of teacher education through innovative and practical collaboration with teacher educators and teachers in other European countries and by sharing experiences for the further development of teacher education in Europe. This collaboration will address the key priorities of the European Union such as learning in the digital world, sustainability, equity and inclusion, also by offering teachers courses, modules and other learning opportunities on these topics. </span></li><li><span>Develop and test jointly different models of <strong>mobility (virtual, physical and blended)</strong> in initial teacher education and as part of teachers\u2019 continuous professional development in order to enhance the quality and number of mobility as well as to make mobility an integral part of teacher education provision in Europe. </span></li><li><span>Develop <strong>sustainable collaboration</strong> between teacher education providers with an impact to the quality of teacher education in Europe and with a view to inform teacher education polices at European and national levels.</span></li> </ul><p><strong><span>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA </span></strong></p><p><span>In order to be eligible for an Erasmus+ grant, project proposals for Erasmus+ Teacher Academies must comply with the following criteria:</span></p><p><strong><span>Who can apply?</span></strong></p><p><span>Any nationally recognised organisation (with the features of a participating organisation as listed below) established in a <strong>Programme Country</strong> can be the applicant.

They shall address the distinct needs of <strong>student teachers</strong> (as part of their initial education) and <strong>serving teachers</strong> (as part of continuous professional development). </span></li><li><strong><span>Develop joint learning offer with a strong European dimension</span></strong><span> that includes mobility activities in all its forms, setting up, for instance summer schools, study visits for students and teachers as well as other forms of cross-campus collaboration, both physical and virtual. </span></li><li><span>Identify effective ways to remove obstacles of mobility and identify conditions, including practical arrangements and recognition of learning, in order to increase the number and quality of mobility and its inclusion as an integral part of initial and continuous learning offer for teachers. </span></li><li><span>Involve schools and in particular <strong>training schools</strong> to experiment and share innovative new ways of teaching (including for distance and blended approaches to teaching and learning). </span></li><li><span>Undertake, in line with the objectives of this call, studies, research and/or surveys or collections of effective practices to produce summaries, discussion papers, recommendations etc. to stimulate discussion and to inform policies on teacher education. </span></li><li><span>Promote and give preference to the existing Erasmus+ tools, such as <strong>eTwinning and School Education Gateway</strong>, for virtual mobility, collaboration, communication for testing and sharing results.</span></li> </ul><p><strong><span>EXPECTED IMPACT </span></strong></p><p><span>The development of the Erasmus+ Teacher Academies is expected to <strong>improve the attractiveness</strong> of the teaching profession and to <strong>ensure high-quality initial education and continuous professional development</strong> for teachers, educators and school leaders. </span></p><p><span>Erasmus+ Teacher Academies are expected to <strong>enhance the European dimension and internationalisation of teacher education</strong> by creating European partnerships of teacher education and training providers. The close collaboration between relevant actors across European borders envisages innovative European cooperation and substantial development of teacher education policies and practices, building upon the existing innovations and effective practices within national teacher education systems and on the joint learning offer organized for participating teachers. This approach is expected to pave the way to make <strong>mobility an integral part of teacher education provision</strong> in Europe, by removing actual obstacles to mobility and by identifying conditions for successful mobility strategies and programmes. </span></p><p><span>Operating at national and European level, the Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will form strong and sustained partnerships between providers of initial teacher education and continuing professional development. They will provide closer co-cooperation between teacher education providers, paving the way towards <strong>structural partnerships and joint programmes between institutions</strong>. Erasmus+ Teacher Academies will thereby ensure high quality, effective initial and continuous professional development and achieve results that would be difficult to obtain without knowledge sharing and effective cooperation. </span></p><p><span>Through the use of various dissemination channels at transnational, national and/or regional levels as well as the deployment of a long-term action plan for the progressive roll-out of project deliverables, projects are expected to engage relevant stakeholders within and outside the participating organisations and ensure a lasting impact also after the project lifetime.</span></p><p><strong><span>AWARD CRITERIA</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#333333;\"><span>The following award criteria apply:</span></span></p><p><strong><span>Relevance of the project</span></strong><span> (maximum score 35 points)</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong><span>Link to policy</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal establishes and develops a European partnerships of teacher education and training providers to set up Erasmus+ Teacher Academies with innovative learning offer to teachers; </span></li><li><strong><span>Consistency</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal is based on an adequate needs analysis; clearly defined and realistic goals, and addresses issues relevant to the participating organisations and to the action; </span></li><li><strong><span>Innovative approach</span></strong><span>: the proposal considers state-of-the-art methods and techniques, and leads to innovative results and solutions for its field in general, or for the geographical context in which the project is implemented (e.g. content; outputs produced, working methods applied, organisations and persons involved or targeted); </span></li><li><strong><span>Cooperation and partnerships</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal is suitable of realising a strong and on-going relationship at both local, national and transnational levels between providers of initial teacher education (pre-service for future teachers) and providers of continuing professional development (in<span><span>[1]</span></span></span>service), in which interactions are reciprocal and mutually beneficial;</li><li><strong><span>European added value</span></strong><span>: the proposal clearly demonstrates the added value at the individual (learner and/or staff), institutional and systemic levels, generated through results that would be difficult to attain by the partners acting without European cooperation; the proposal uses and promotes the existing tools at EU level such as eTwinning and School Education Gateway for collaboration, communication, and for testing and sharing results;</span></li><li><strong><span>Internationalisation</span></strong><span>: the proposal demonstrates its contribution to the international dimension of teacher education, including the development of joint models of mobility (virtual, physical and blended) and other learning offer in initial teacher education and teachers\u2019 continuous professional development; </span></li><li><strong><span>Digital skills</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal foresees activities related to digital skills development (e.g. the design of innovative curricula and teaching methodologies, effective learning modules, etc.); </span></li><li><strong><span>Green skills</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal foresees activities (e.g. innovative curricula and teaching methodologies, effective learning modules etc.) linked to European priorities on environmental sustainability and the transition to a circular and greener economy; </span></li><li><strong><span>Social dimension</span></strong><span>: the proposal includes a horizontal concern throughout the various actions to address diversity and promote shared values, equality, non<span><span>[1]</span></span></span>discrimination and social inclusion, including for people with special needs/fewer opportunities and working in multilingual and multicultural contexts;</li><li><strong><span>Gender sensitivity</span></strong><span>: the extent to which the proposal addresses gender equality and helps to find solutions to effectively foster gender sensitive teaching in schools.</span></li> </ul><p><strong><span>Quality of the project design and implementation</span></strong><span> (maximum score 25 points)</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong><span>Coherence</span></strong><span>: the overall project design ensures consistency between project objectives, activities and the budget proposed.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market. Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, while speaking two other languages in addition to ones\u2019 mother tongue should be the norm. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Youth Strategy and the European Union </span><span>Workplan</span><span> for Sport. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. </span><strong>It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties.</strong><span> In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its </span><span>participants,</span><span> in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Furthermore, </span><strong>developing digital </strong><strong>skills and competences</strong><strong> and skills in forward-looking fields</strong><span>, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. </span><span>The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation.</span><span> This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organis</span><span>ations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life.</span><span> </span><strong>Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance</strong><span> for the European Union's future. </span><span>This issue </span><span>can also be targeted</span><span> through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>In line with the European Union\u2019s priorities in making sustainable its economy, </span><strong>projects </strong><strong>should be designed</strong><strong> in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets</strong><span>. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them </span><span>think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning. It facilitates the circulation of ideas and the transmission of best practices and expertise and the development of digital capabilities thus contributing to a high quality education while strengthening social cohesion.</span><span> The Erasmus+ Programme is one of the European Union\u2019s most visible success stories. It builds on the achievements of more than 30 years of European programmes in the fields of education, training, youth and sport, covering both an intra-European as well as an international partnerships dimension. </span><span> </span></p><p><span> </span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 11, 2022 6:48:30 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 11, 2022 6:48:30 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EVALUATION RESULTS&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Published: 20/04/2021</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Deadline:&nbsp;&nbsp; 07/09/2021<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Available budget: EUR </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">15,000,000&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The results of the evaluation are as follows<font color=\"#4aa55b\" face=\"Calibri, sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px;\">:</span></font><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Number of proposals submitted (including proposals transferred from or to other calls): 56 proposals submitted <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Number of inadmissible proposals: 0<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Number of ineligible proposals: 4<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Number of above-threshold proposals: 31<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Total budget requested for above-threshold proposals: EUR 15.192.767,26&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype\r\nid=\"_x0000_t75\" coordsize=\"21600,21600\" o:spt=\"75\" o:preferrelative=\"t\"\r\npath=\"m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe\" filled=\"f\" stroked=\"f\">\r\n<v:stroke joinstyle=\"miter\" />\r\n<v:formulas>\r\n<v:f eqn=\"if lineDrawn pixelLineWidth 0\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"sum @0 1 0\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"sum 0 0 @1\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @2 1 2\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @3 21600 pixelWidth\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @3 21600 pixelHeight\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"sum @0 0 1\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @6 1 2\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @7 21600 pixelWidth\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"sum @8 21600 0\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"prod @7 21600 pixelHeight\" />\r\n<v:f eqn=\"sum @10 21600 0\" />\r\n</v:formulas>\r\n<v:path o:extrusionok=\"f\" gradientshapeok=\"t\" o:connecttype=\"rect\" />\r\n<o:lock v:ext=\"edit\" aspectratio=\"t\" />\r\n</v:shapetype><v:shape id=\"_x0000_i1025\" type=\"#_x0000_t75\" style='width:9.5pt;\r\nheight:9.5pt'>\r\n<v:imagedata src=\"file:///C:/Users/cabecro/AppData/Local/Temp/1/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png\"\r\no:title=\"\" />\r\n</v:shape><![endif]--><!--[if !vml]--><img width=\"13\" height=\"13\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/cabecro/AppData/Local/Temp/1/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1025\" alt=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--[endif]--></span><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;&#10;color:#0165A3\">&nbsp;</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">For questions, p</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\">lease contact: <a href=\"mailto:eacea-eplus-teacher-academies@ec.europa.eu\"><span style=\"mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;color:black;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:&#10;black;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:100.0%\">eacea-eplus-teacher-academies@ec.europa.eu</span></a><b><i><o:p></o:p></i></b></span></p>\r\n<div><br />\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>"}, {"approvalDate": "Apr 28, 2021 4:38:21 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Apr 28, 2021 4:38:21 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: ERASMUS-EDU-2021-PEX-TEACH-ACA(ERASMUS-PJG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
