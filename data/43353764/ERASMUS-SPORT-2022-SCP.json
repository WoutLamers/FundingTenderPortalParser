This organisation applies on behalf of all participating organisations involved in the project. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhich types of organisations are eligible to participate in the project? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny public or private organisation, established in an EU Member State or third country associated to the Programme or in any third country not associated to the Programme of the world (see section &ldquo;Eligible Countries&rdquo; in Part A of this Guide) can participate in a Cooperation Partnership <em>(Any higher education institution (HEI) established in a EU Member State or third country associated to the Programme and wanting to participate in a Cooperation Partnership must hold a valid Erasmus Charter for Higher Education (ECHE). An ECHE is not required for participating HEIs in third countries not associated to the Programme, but they will have to sign up to its principles. For the purpose of this Action, informal groups of young people are not to be considered as an organisation, and are therefore not eligible to participate (neither as applicants nor as partners)</em>. Organisations established in EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme can either participate as the coordinator of the project or as a partner organisation.</p>\r\n<p>Organisations in third countries not associated to the Programme cannot participate as project coordinators. Irrespective of the field impacted by the project, Cooperation Partnerships are open to any type of organisation active in any field of education, training, youth, sport or other socio-economic sectors as well as to organisations carrying out activities that are transversal to different fields (e.g. local, regional and national authorities, recognition and validation centres, chambers of commerce, trade organisations, guidance centres, cultural and sport organisations).</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the priority and the objectives addressed by the project, Cooperation Partnerships should involve the most appropriate and diverse range of partners in order to benefit from their different experiences, profiles and specific expertise and to produce relevant and high quality project results. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nParticipation of associated partner organisations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the organisations formally participating in the project (the coordinator and partner organisations), Cooperation Partnerships may also involve other partners from the public or private sector that contribute to the implementation of specific project tasks/activities or support the promotion and sustainability of the project. Within an Erasmus+ project, these partners will be called &ldquo;associated partners&rdquo;. For eligibility and contractual management aspects they are not considered to be project partners, and they do not receive any funding from the Programme as part of the project. However, in order to understand their role within the partnership and have a global picture about the proposal, their involvement in the project and in the different activities needs to be clearly described. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNumber and profile of participating organisations<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Cooperation Partnership is a transnational project and involves minimum three organisations from three different EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme. There is no maximum number of participating organisations in one partnership. All participating organisations must be identified at the time of applying for a grant. As a general rule, Cooperation Partnerships target the cooperation between organisations established in EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme. However, organisations from third countries not associated to the Programme can be involved as partners (not as applicants), if their participation brings an essential added value to the project and as long as the minimum participation from three organisations from three different EU Member States and third countries associated to the Programme is fulfilled. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPriorities addressed<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be considered for funding, Cooperation Partnerships must address either: at least one horizontal priority and/or at least one specific priority relevant to the field of education, training, youth and sport that is mostly impacted. For projects in the field of sport only one priority (horizontal or specific) can be addressed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVenue of the activities <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll the activities of a Cooperation Partnership must take place in the countries of the organisations participating in the project, either as full or as associated partners. In addition, if duly justified in relation to the objectives or implementation of the project: Activities can also take place at the seat of an Institution of the European Union <em>(Seats of the Institutions of the European Union are Brussels, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Strasbourg, and The Hague)</em>, even if in the project there are no participating organisations from the country that hosts the Institution. Activities involving sharing and promotion of results can also take place at relevant thematic transnational events/conferences in Programme or third countries not associated to the Programme. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuration of project<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween 12 and 36 months. The duration has to be chosen at application stage, based on the objectives of the project and on the type of activities planned over time. The duration of a Cooperation Partnership may be extended, upon justified request by the beneficiary and with the agreement of the National or Executive Agency, (provided that the total duration does not exceed 36 months). In such a case, the total grant will not change. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>ADMISSIBILITY CONDITIONS</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nApplications must be sent no later than the deadline for submitting applications as indicated in the call.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- For actions managed by the Executive Agency, applications must be submitted electronically via the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Electronic Submission System: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home. Applications (including annexes and supporting documents) must be submitted using the forms provided in the Submission System. Applications are limited to 40 pages for calls for low value grants (EUR 60 000 or below); and 70 for other calls. Evaluators will not consider any additional pages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe applications must be readable and accessible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApplications must be complete containing all parts and mandatory annexes. Only clerical errors can be corrected after the submission deadline upon request of the managing agency. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>FUNDING RULES</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe proposed funding model consists of a menu of 3 single lump sums, corresponding to the total grant amount for the project: 120 000 EUR, 250 000 EUR and 400 000 EUR. Applicants will choose between the 3 pre-defined amounts according to the activities they want to undertake and the results they want to achieve.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen planning their projects, the applicant organisations - together with their project partners - will need to choose the single lump sum amount more appropriate to cover the costs of their projects, based on their needs and objectives. If the project is selected for funding, the requested lump sum amount becomes the overall grant amount.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProposals must describe the activities that applicants commit to carry out with the lump sum amount requested and must satisfy the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe choice of the lump sum amount to be requested should be based on the applicant&rsquo;s own estimate for the overall cost of the project. Starting from this estimate, applicants must choose the single lump sum amount that suits best their needs while ensuring an efficient use of the funds and the respect of the co-financing principle (i.e. project budgets are expected to be complemented with other funding sources, therefore the expected overall cost of the project shall be higher than the fixed lump sum amount requested).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn case of doubts between two amounts, applicants can: a) reduce the cost of their project, for instance by finding more cost-effective ways to achieve similar results or by adapting the number/scale of the project activities to the budget; b) increase the scale of their project, for instance by aiming to reaching more participants with their activities, increasing the number of activities or producing additional project outputs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe adequacy of the number, scope and complexity of the proposed project activities to the amount requested, together with their relevance for the project objectives, will be important elements of the quality assessment, in line with the award criteria described above.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;Please refer to Part B of the standard proposal template.</span></p>\r\n<p>Applications are limited to 40 pages for calls for low value grants (EUR 60 000 or below); 70 pages for other calls.

Education, training, youth and sport are key areas that support citizens in their personal and professional development. High quality, inclusive education and training, as well as informal and non-formal learning, ultimately equip young people and participants of all ages with the qualifications and skills needed for their meaningful participation in democratic society, intercultural understanding and successful transition in the labour market.</div>\r\n<div>Building on the success of the programme in the period 2014-2020, Erasmus+ strengthens its efforts to increase the opportunities offered to more participants and to a wider range of organisations, focusing on its qualitative impact and contributing to more inclusive and cohesive, greener and digitally fit societies.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>European citizens need to be better equipped with the knowledge, skills and competences needed in a dynamically changing society that is increasingly mobile, multicultural and digital. Spending time in another country to study, to learn and to work should become the standard, and the opportunity to learn two other languages in addition to one&rsquo;s mother tongue should be offered to everyone. The Programme is a key component supporting the objectives of the European Education Area, the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the European Union Youth Strategy and the European Union Work Plan for Sport (2021-24).</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, access to education is proving, more than ever, to be essential to ensuring a swift recovery, while promoting equal opportunities for all. As part of this recovery process, the Erasmus+ programme takes its inclusive dimension to a new horizon by supporting opportunities for personal, socio-educational and professional development of people in Europe and beyond, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>To increase the qualitative impact of its actions and ensure equal opportunities, the Programme will reach out more and better to people of different ages and from diverse cultural, social and economic backgrounds. It is at the heart of the Programme to come closer to those with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as European Union citizens living in remote areas or facing socio-economic difficulties. In doing so, the Programme will also encourage its participants, in particular young people to engage and learn to participate in civic society, raising awareness about European Union common values.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Furthermore, developing digital skills and competences and skills in forward-looking fields, such as combating climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data analysis, etc. is essential for Europe's future sustainable growth and cohesion. The Programme can make a meaningful contribution by stimulating innovation and bridging Europe's knowledge, skills and competences gap. EU businesses need to become more competitive through talent and innovation. This investment in knowledge, skills and competences will benefit individuals, institutions, organisations and society as a whole by contributing to sustainable growth and ensuring equity, prosperity and social inclusion in Europe and beyond.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Another challenge relates to the Europe-wide trends of limited participation in democratic life and low levels of knowledge and awareness about European matters and their impact on the lives of all European citizens. Many people are reluctant, or face difficulties, in actively engaging and participating in their communities or in the European Union's political and social life. Strengthening European identity and the participation of young people in democratic processes is of paramount importance for the European Union's future. This issue can also be targeted through non-formal learning activities, which aim at enhancing the skills and competences of young people as well as their active citizenship.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>In line with the European Union&rsquo;s priorities in making sustainable its economy, projects should be designed in an eco-friendly manner and should incorporate green practices in all facets. Organisations and participants involved should have an environmental-friendly approach when designing their projects, which will encourage them to discuss and learn about environmental issues, make them think about what can be done at their level and help them come up with alternative greener ways of implementing their activities.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Supporting and facilitating the transnational and international cooperation between organisations in the fields of education, training, youth and sport is essential to empowering people with more key competences, reducing early school leaving and recognising competences acquired through formal, informal and non-formal learning.
