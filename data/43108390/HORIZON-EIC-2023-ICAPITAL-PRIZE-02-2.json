An increasing number of cities are acting as test beds for innovation and run people-driven initiatives to find solutions to societal challenges. The public domain is particularly challenged with finding effective ways to ensure the mainstreaming of these practices into the ordinary urban development process. Successful practices are particularly crucial to enhance the city's capacity to attract new resources, funds and talents to stimulate the growth of breakthrough innovations. Moreover, collaboration and strengthening synergies among innovation ecosystems boost cities\u2019 development and resilience to tackle urban challenges. For this reason, the European Capital of Innovation Awards will recognize the cities\u2019 role as catalysers of the local innovation ecosystem and will stimulate new activities aimed at boosting game-changing innovation.</p><p><u><strong>Categories</strong></u></p><p>In 2023, the European Capital of Innovation Awards will feature two categories.</p><p>The first one, the European Capital of Innovation category, would include cities which have a population of minimum 250 000 inhabitants and, based on the cumulative criteria set out below, would reward the winner (ranked 1st) with EUR 1 million and two runners-up (ranked 2nd and 3rd) with EUR 100 000 each one.</p><p>The second one, the European Rising Innovative City category, would include towns and cities with a population of 50 000 and up to 249 999 inhabitants; and, based on the cumulative criteria set out below, would reward the winner (ranked 1st) with EUR 500 000 and the two runners-up (ranked 2nd and 3rd) with EUR 50 000 each one.
