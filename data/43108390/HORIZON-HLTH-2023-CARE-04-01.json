Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019, </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em> and <em>\u2018A Competitive and secure data economy</em>\u2019.</p><p>Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.</p><p>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens\u2019 health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised medicine</li><li>Increasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discrimination</li><li>Improving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce, including informal carers</li><li>Enhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the European Green Deal.</li> </ul><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 <em>\u201cCulture, Creativity and Inclusive Society</em>\u201d such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil Security for Society\u201d</em> such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation); with cluster 5 \u201c<em>Climate, Energy and Mobility\u201d; </em>and cluster 6<em> \u201cFood, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment\u201d</em>.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally.

Many systems were overwhelmed and fell short on available supplies, staff, and critical infrastructure. Beyond the initial challenges posed by the pandemic, its prolonged duration has strained health and care facilities and providers, and had a negative impact on regular health and care provision. Disruptions in routine and non-emergency medical care access and delivery have been observed. It is hence timely to take stock and identify lessons for maintaining care delivery.</p><p>Another recent emergency situation that has had a great impact on health and care systems is the war in Ukraine and the resulting migration to bordering countries. Also under these circumstances, it is important to have the right tools for maintaining access to regular health and care services, while also accommodating the more urgent needs of migrants, for example.</p><p>The goal is to be better prepared for the multiple challenges faced by health and care systems during emergencies, and ensure that necessary access to regular health and care services can be maintained.</p><p>Proposals for research and innovation should focus on health and care systems, and actions are expected to address several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Analysis and evaluation of different epidemics or other emergencies response measures in Member States and Associated Countries aimed at maintaining access to regular health and care services. Cost studies on not maintaining access to health and care services during cross-border emergencies.</li><li>Development of innovative tools and models for maintaining access to regular health and care services during cross-border emergencies \u2013 for example developing modelling and foresight tools to assess and anticipate impact of cross-border emergencies on regular health and care delivery; developing novel technical solutions or organisational management models, including training, for regular care delivery in future cross-border emergencies; demonstrating applicability of novel modelling tools, management frameworks and organisational models in selected areas of regular health and care services (e.g. chronic diseases, mental health disorders, trauma care).</li><li>Development and implementation of digital tools and of effective communication strategies based on digital health literacy studies \u2013 for example developing, implementing and generating evidence of benefit of novel digital systems connecting health and care professionals, citizens and patients at-scale, helping maintain access to health and care services during emergencies (including but not limited to smart appointment management, chronic disease self-management applications, primary care and/or referral caseload prioritisation and management incl. triage, increasing clinical practice efficiency, management of health care professionals\u2019 caseload, integrated telecare suites complemented by new computational methods such as AI/machine learning, etc.).</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Interdisciplinary research is thus encouraged, including the involvement of SSH disciplines considered essential for health and care planning and delivery in different social contexts and for the evaluation of health economical aspects.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Synergies should be sought with potentially complementary research initiatives, data stewards, custodians and research infrastructures such as the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure, the future European co-funded partnerships<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, such as the partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS), and relevant EU health policy initiatives such as the European Health Data Space (EHDS)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> and the nascent Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.
