CCAM solutions will shift design and development from a driver-centred to mobility-user oriented approach, providing viable alternatives for private vehicle ownership while increasing inclusiveness of mobility.

It aims to harmonise European R&amp;I efforts to accelerate the implementation of innovative CCAM technologies and services. It aims to exploit the full systemic benefits of new mobility solutions enabled by CCAM.

In particular, the areas of infrastructure, logistics and network/traffic management play a major role in making mobility and transport climate neutral, also through the digitalisation of the sectors. At the same time, being vulnerable to climate change and other disruptions, resilience in these three areas need to be increased. New and advanced infrastructures across all transport modes are required to enable the introduction of new vehicles, operations and mobility services. Furthermore, efficient and smart multimodal logistics are key for seamless and sustainable long-haul, regional and urban freight transport movements. Finally, dynamic multimodal network and traffic management systems are the \u201cglue\u201d of the entire transport network, for optimised door-to-door mobility of both passengers and freight.</p><p>To test solutions related to multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and good, applicants may seek possibilities of involving the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy and mobility applications of the JRC Living Lab for Future Urban Ecosystems[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc\">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc</a>]].</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting Multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and goods under this Destination are:</p><ul><li>Upgraded and resilient physical and digital infrastructure for clean, accessible, affordable, connected and automated multimodal mobility.</li><li>Sustainable and smart long-haul, regional and urban freight transport and logistics, through increased efficiency, improved interconnectivity and smart enforcement.</li><li>Reduced external costs (e.g. congestion, traffic jams, emissions, air and noise pollution, road collisions) of urban, peri-urban (regional) and long distance freight transport as well as optimised system-wide network efficiency and resilience.</li><li>Enhanced local and/or regional capacity for governance and innovation in urban mobility and logistics.</li></ul><p><i><strong><u>Safety and resilience - per mode and across all transport modes</u></strong></i></p><p>Safety and resilience are of primary concern for any transport system. The EU set ambitious targets in its 2011 Transport White Paper, the third Mobility Package and, more recently, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[[COM(2020) 789 final.]]. COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the importance of resilience to external disruptions, particularly for transport. Research and innovation will underpin the three pillars affecting safety and resilience: technologies; regulations (alongside acceptable level of risks); and human factors (individual and organisational aspects, including interaction with automation). The approach is risk-based and systemic, including transport means/vehicles, infrastructure, the physical environment (e.g. weather) and the various actors (e.g. manufacturers, regulators, operators, users) as well as all their interfaces, including certification and standardisation bodies.</p><p>Synergies should be exploited across research at national, EU and international level together with national authorities, EU agencies and international organisations to improve rulemaking, safety promotion and oversight.</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting transport safety and resilience under this Destination are:</p><p><i>Safety in Urban Areas/ Road Transport Safety</i></p><ul><li>50% reduction in serious injuries and fatalities in road crashes by 2030.</li><li>Improved reliability and performance of systems that aim to anticipate and minimize safety risks, avoiding risks and collisions, and reducing the consequences of unavoidable crashes.</li><li>Drastic reduction of road fatalities and serious crash injuries in low and medium income countries in Africa.</li><li>Better design principles of future road transport systems enabling also better traffic flow in big cities.</li></ul><p><i>Waterborne Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Ensure healthy passenger shipping by preventing and mitigating the spread of contagious diseases and infections.</li></ul><p><i>Aviation Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Decrease number of accidents and incidents due to organisational/human/automation factors and external hazards in all phases of flight, also beyond CAT category (80% goal in FlightPath2050), while enabling all weather operations.</li><li>Saving lives following a crash (post-crash survivability).</li><li>Anticipate emergence of new threats that could generate potential accidents and incidents (short, medium, and long term).</li><li>Ensure safety through aviation transformation (from green/digital technologies uptake up to independent certification).</li><li>Maintain safety and resilience despite the scale, pace and diversity of new entrants.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Safe, Resilient Transport and Smart Mobility services for passengers and goods", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["impact assessment", "needs", "citizens", "acceptance", "social innovation", "civil society", "users"], "keywords": ["Transport engineering", "Societal Engagement", "Socio-economic science and humanities", "Co-programmed European Partnerships", "Transport engineering, intelligent transport syste", "Social Innovation", "International Cooperation"], "flags": ["SocietalEngagement", "PART-COPROGR", "SSH", "SocInnov", "EC-WORLD"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-RIA HORIZON  Research and Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "24 June 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["19 October 2021"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3352273": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-01 -
