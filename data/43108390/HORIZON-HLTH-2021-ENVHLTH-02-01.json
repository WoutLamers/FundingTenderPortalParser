Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <i>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019 </i>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<i>living and working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better understanding of environmental, occupational, social and economic determinants of health\u2019</i>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <i>\u2018Good health and high quality accessible health care\u2019</i>, <i>\u2018Climate change mitigation and </i>adaptation\u2019, and <i>\u2018</i>Clean<i> and healthy air, water and soil\u2019</i>.</p><p>The environment we live and work in is a major determinant of our health and well-being. It has direct or indirect beneficial or adverse impact on our health and well-being. Environmental factors are estimated to account for almost 20% of all deaths in Europe. Opinion surveys have shown that European citizens are concerned about the impact of pollution on their health. The impacting factors on both physical and mental health and well-being are not all identified nor their effects comprehensively understood and accounted for to support evidence-based policy- and decision-making. Furthermore, agreed methodologies to estimate health-related costs of exposure to environmental stressors are lacking.</p><p>Therefore, Destination 2 aims at filling knowledge gaps in the understanding of the impacts on our health and well-being of those environmental, occupational and socio-economic risk factors that have the most significant or widespread societal impacts. In this work programme, Destination 2 focuses on indoor and outdoor air pollution, chemicals, non-ionizing radiation (electromagnetic fields), urbanisation, climate and other environmental changes, socio-economic inequalities, and changing working environments. Furthermore, under this work programme a topic is dedicated to the creation of a European partnership for the assessment of risks from chemicals, which should establish the EU as an internationally recognised driver of innovative chemical risk assessment for an optimal protection of human health and the environment. The results will support the EU\u2019s environment and health policies and overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal, the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the 8th Environment Action Programme, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work as well as the WHO European Environment and Health Process (EHP).</p><p>Strong collaborations across sectors and with other Horizon Europe clusters dealing with issues such as agriculture, food, environment, climate, mobility, security, urban planning, social inclusion and gender will be needed to ensure that maximal societal benefits are reached. Thus, in view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe).</p><p>All topics are open to international collaboration to address global environment and health challenges.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to living and working in a health-promoting environment, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Policy-makers and regulators are aware and well informed about environmental, socio-economic and occupational risk factors as well as health-promoting factors across society;</li><li>Environmental, occupational, social, economic, fiscal and health policies and practices at the EU, national and regional level are sustainable and based on solid scientific evidence.

The use of the new generation radio-communication networks, e.g. 5G (the fifth generation of mobile phone technology), promise higher data transfer rates and increased network capacity compared with previous generations. While digitalisation presents new opportunities, e.g. distance monitoring of air and water pollution and health outcomes, it also presents potential health risks. Europe needs a digital sector that puts sustainability at its heart: when deploying new technologies, the potential risks related to human health should also be assessed, in addition to the significant benefits. </span></p><p><span>There has been an exponential increase in the use of wireless personal communication devices (mobile phones, WiFi or Bluetooth-enabled devices etc.) by almost all citizens in private and professional settings and in the supporting infrastructures. The number of other applications using EMF has also increased such as security scanners, smart meters and medical equipment. This has resulted in an increase in man-made electromagnetic radiation in our surroundings.</span></p><p><span>The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) issues guidelines for limiting exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. EU member states are subject to Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC and the Directive 2013/35/EU, which follow basic rules on EMF exposure evaluation provided by ICNIRP guidelines. Nevertheless, there is some concern over the possible impact on health and safety from potentially higher exposure to EMF, e.g. arising from the deployment of 5G technology. Increased exposure may result from, for instance, the additional use of higher frequencies, and from the potential aggregation of different signals, especially in cities.</span></p><p><span>Research actions under this topic should provide forward-looking information on potential hazards and risks of existing and emerging EMF exposures through innovative monitoring techniques, experimental evidence and modelling and should include all of the following activities:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Monitoring of exposures of the general population and specific groups at risk such as children and workers using innovative technologies;</span></li><li><span>Establishment of potentially new exposure patterns and comparison with existing patterns, e.g. those generated by the use of previous generations of mobile phone technologies. It should be documented how exposures to EMF changes over time due to the introduction of new technologies, including 5G, supporting infrastructure, radiofrequency bands, modulation techniques and applications; </span></li><li><span>Investigating evidence of local and systemic biological effects and health impacts across the lifecycle using <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> approaches, respecting the 3Rs</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup><span> principle, and taking into account combined exposures and changing patterns of device use;</span></li><li><span>Delivering FAIR</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup><span> data on the causal links between level and duration of exposures and potential health (biological) effects, including potential mechanisms, in living and working environments, considering also vulnerable groups, particularly children;</span></li><li><span>Proposing new quality criteria and standards (CEN/ISO</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup><span>) for the analytical methodologies used for the assessment of exposure to EMF and their impact on human health and on the environment; </span></li><li><span>Undertaking case studies on solutions for exposure reduction based on acquired evidence and deliver practical guidelines for exposure prevention along the stakeholder chain; </span></li><li><span>Proposing and testing efficient communication methods and tools for engaging citizens in preventive actions and addressing their concerns. </span></li> </ul><p><span>Aspects such as gender, age, regional variations, socio-economics and culture should be considered, where appropriate.</span></p><p><span>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
