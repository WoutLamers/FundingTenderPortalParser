This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and approving the capability roadmap for the European Border and Coast Guard, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist the European Commission in drawing up and implementing, relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.</p><p>Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.</p><p>This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.</p><p>Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf</a>]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN</a>]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp; Innovation funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, the Community of European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) or with other security research and innovation working groups set-up by EU Agencies<em>.</em></p><p>Furthermore, successful proposals under this Destination should be complementary and not overlap with relevant actions funded by other EU instruments, including projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme as well as the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)), while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this Destination should demonstrate how they plan to build on relevant predecessor projects; to consider the citizens\u2019 and societal perspectives; to include education, training and awareness raising for practitioners and citizens; to measure the achieved TRL; and to prepare the uptake of the research outcomes.</p><p>Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to make use primarily of Copernicus data, services and technologies.</p><p>This Destination will develop knowledge and technologies that may be taken up by other instruments, such as the Integrated Border Management Fund, in its components of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI), that will enable exploitation of research results and final delivery of the required tools to security practitioners.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:</p><p><em>\u201cLegitimate passengers and shipments travel more easily into the EU, while illicit trades, trafficking, piracy, terrorist and other criminal acts are prevented, due to improved air, land and sea border management and maritime security including better knowledge on social factors.\u201d</em></p><p>More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improved security (as well as better cost- and energy- efficient management) of EU land and air borders, as well as sea borders and maritime environment, infrastructures and activities, as well as for the EU external civilian security, against accidents, natural disasters and security challenges such as illegal trafficking, piracy and potential terrorist attacks, cyber and hybrid threats;</li><li>Improved border crossing experience for travellers and border authorities staff (including customs, coast and border guards), while maintaining security and monitoring of movements across air, land and sea EU external borders, supporting the Schengen area, reducing illegal movements of people and goods across those borders and protecting fundamental rights of travellers, both EU citizens and Third Country Nationals;</li> </ul><p>Improved customs and supply chain security though better prevention, detection, deterrence and fight of illegal activities involving flows of goods across EU external border crossing points and through the supply chain, as well as through better interoperability, minimising disruption to trade flows.</p><p>Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.</p>", "destinationDescription": "Effective management of EU external borders (2023/24)", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["border

its borders.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Biometrics are one of the most usable and most reliable ways to validate the identity of an individual. Biometrics that are traditionally used in the context of border controls include fingerprints and 2D facial images; other biometrics are also used for identity management outside the European Union, or at national level, such as iris; and further others are used in other applications in the private sector and in consumer market.</p><p>As for many other technologies, applications of biometrics to improve capabilities in civil security, such as in the border management or law enforcement sectors, may have higher requirements than applications in the consumer market. This applies to the requirements on reliability, usability, scalability, throughput and strict minimization of risks to personal data protection and fundamental rights (including the elimination or minimisation of any risk of bias or discrimination).</p><p>Research should assess and develop the fit-for-purpose border management of biometric identification modalities beyond fingerprints and facial images, and/or innovative modalities of acquisition of those and other biometrics. Proposed projects should particularly investigate biometrics modalities that currently do not offer satisfactory performance (in terms of accuracy, reliability, usability, minimisation of data protection risk and risk of bias etc.) but potentially offer significant advantages over existing solutions in the short or medium term for applications in a border checks context.</p><p>Any innovation in biometrics shall imply clear improvements on acquisition, processing and validation, compared to the state-of-the-art, \u201con-the-move\u201d (i.e. while the travellers are moving and without cooperation from them), contactless and with stand-off biometric capturing from long-distances (ideally, but not mandatorily, more than 10 meters), and/or of when multiple travellers cross borders, on foot or inside the same vehicle. The solutions should also take into account the different nature and scenarios of BCP operations (e.g. open-air conditions, night, time, time constraints, space constraints, etc.).</p><p>The solutions should comply with the requirements of current and foreseen EU large-scale IT systems on borders and visa (e.g. the Entry/Exit System), as well as with interoperability frameworks between EU large-scale IT systems on borders, visas, asylum and migration, as well as on police and judicial cooperation.</p><p>The proposed solutions should comply with EU data protection law, and, amongst others, embed data protection by design and by default and ensure transparency vis-\u00e0-vis the concerned individuals and avoid abuses of their personal data. The solutions should also meet robust fundamental rights impact assessment frameworks. Developed solutions could indeed help reduce the amount of biometric data needed to achieve improved reliability of identification, including by acquiring and using less personal data compared to the state-of-the-art.</p><p>The project should also study the stability over time of collected biometrics, and if and how it would be possible to \u201cre-use\u201d collected biometrics in a secure and privacy-friendly manner, for the same purposes and according to allowed uses, collected biometrics, and avoid collecting the same biometrics multiple times.</p><p>The proposed solution(s) should address modular integration with health checks \u2013 such as in the case of pandemics \u2013 as well as checks on people\u2019s temperature. At system-level, emphasis should be given to automated border check for the purpose of guiding travellers on-the-move while performing the seamless biometric acquisition. Systems should also be compatible with policies and measures typically introduced during pandemics (e.g. the use of facemasks and social distancing).</p><p>The proposed solutions should include automated decision support systems for the biometric recognition process suggesting to the end-users (border checks operators) which procedure, technology or database can be used without infringing rights of travellers.</p><p>The developed solutions need to comply with the Ethics Guidelines on Trustworthy AI (2019)<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>, the EU values and fundamental rights, including on data protection and avoid bias and discrimination.</p><p>EU border authorities in the consortia should plan to take up the results of the research, assuming the project delivers on its goals and is compatible with applicable legislation, using the financial support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).</p><p>Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): 3D facial images, contactless friction-ridge biometrics (i.e. fingerprint, palmprint and finger-knuckle-print), iris recognition from long distances, palm vein, periocular biometrics, novel algorithms embedding artificial intelligence as well as advanced hardware components like sensors, traveller tracking systems for high-quality on-the-move biometric acquisition, safe single wavelength or multispectral light sources (for the illumination of subjects) and document verification subsystems.</p><p>Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research, and projects funded under <em>HORIZON-CL3-2021-BM-01-03: Improved border checks for travel facilitation across external borders and improved experiences for both passengers and border authorities\u2019 staff</em> and <em>HORIZON-CL3-2022-BM-01-02: Enhanced security of, and combating the frauds on, identity management and identity and travel documents</em>.</p><p>Proposals should delineate concrete, clear and convincing plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment in operational context of border checks) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex and of eu-LISA will observe projects\u2019 pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.</p><p>The funded projects will likely have the opportunity of exploiting the core capabilities of the \u201cFrontex Technology and Innovation Centre\u201d (FIT, formerly BoMIC), Frontex\u2019s future collaborative physical space for testing, demonstration, simulation and assessment of border-check prototype systems, processes and procedures with a focus on human-machine interaction and emulation of real operational environments.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai\">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai</a></p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
