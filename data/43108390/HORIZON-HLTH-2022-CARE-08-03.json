Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019, </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em> and <em>\u2018A Competitive and secure data economy</em>\u2019.</span></p><p><span>Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems. </span></p><p><span>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and, consequently, allow improving governance of the European health care systems, supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens\u2019 health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</span></p><p><span>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Modernising health care systems in the EU, especially through a European public-public partnership on transforming health and care systems;</span></li><li><span>Improving the quality of health care along the entire health care continuum and being people-centred;</span></li><li><span>Supporting evidence-based health care decisions both for health care providers and policy-makers, fostering improved foresight and enabling sound planning of health care resources; </span></li><li><span>Enhancing development and uptake of innovative health care services and solutions, including environmentally sustainable ones that contribute to the European Green Deal. </span></li> </ul><p><span>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 <em>\u201cCulture, Creativity and Inclusive Society</em>\u201d such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil Security for Society\u201d</em> such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation).</span></p><p><u><span>Expected impacts:</span></u></p><p><span>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public health needs, while patient safety and quality of services is increased. </span></li><li><span>Health care providers are trained and equipped with the skills and competences suited for the future needs of health care systems that are modernised, digitally transformed and equipped with innovative tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care. They save time and resources by integrating and applying innovative technologies, which better involve patients in their own care, by reorganising workflows and redistributing tasks and responsibilities throughout the health care system, and by monitoring and analysing corresponding health care activities. </span></li><li><span>Citizens are supported to play a key role in managing their own health care, informal carers (including unpaid carers) are fully supported (e.g. by preventing overburdening and economic stress) and specific needs of more vulnerable groups are recognised and addressed. They benefit from improved access to health care services, including financial risk protection, timely access to quality essential health care services, including safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines. </span></li><li><span>Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities, organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making. </span></li><li><span>The actions resulting from the calls under this destination will also create strong opportunities for synergies with the EU4Health programme and in particular to contribute to the goals under general objectives 1a \u201cprotecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination among the Member States to cope with those threats\u201d and 3 \u201cstrengthening health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency, in particular through: i) supporting integrated and coordinated work between Member States; ii) promoting the implementation of best practices on data sharing; iii) reinforcing the healthcare workforce; iv) tackling the implications of demographic challenges; and v) advancing digital transformation\u201d.</span></li> </ul>", "destinationDescription": "Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["Deployment", "Digital & green transiton", "Preparedness", "healthcare systems", "Demand driven innovation"], "keywords": ["Types of innovation", "Health care sciences and services (including hospi", "Social sciences and humanities", "Public and environmental health", "Innovation Procurement", "Artificial Intelligence", "Digital Agenda"], "flags": ["SSH", "InnovationProcurement", "AI", "DigitalAgenda"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-PPI HORIZON Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "06 October 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["21 April 2022"]}], "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 8, 2022 10:20:24 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 8, 2022 10:20:24 AM", "content": "<p>We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals submitted under this call.

This can support the economic recovery of the EU by providing incentives to the EU health and technology industry (especially spin-offs, start-ups and SMEs) to innovate and by providing business opportunities to commercialise innovative products or services at a larger scale than they would normally have. By acting as early adopters of such innovative solutions, procurers can open up new growth markets for the EU industry, thereby contributing to EU growth, employment and competitiveness. At the same time, joint/collaborative demand-side initiatives can help create economies of scale and scale up the wider adoption of innovations by the health sector. Advances in this area can help EU health care systems build resilience and respond to public health threats better than if they would act individually.</span></p><p><span>The actions supported will target critical-scale deployment of relevant health care solutions across different regions in Europe by engaging public and/or private procurers from each participating country (at national, regional or local level) that have deployment responsibilities and budget control in the relevant area of care or supply of services. Procurers will specify, purchase and deploy solutions addressing their relevant, shared unmet needs, while engaging together in a supply and demand side dialogue, in order for the deployed solutions to deliver sustainable, new or improved health care services and outcomes, always taking into account patient feedback. Specific guidance on PPI actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annex H</span><span>of the Horizon Europe work programme.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should therefore be based on clearly identified user needs and well-structured work plans, explaining how the procurement of the innovative solutions will contribute to the expected outcomes. In addition, proposals should clearly state the benefits of the solutions that will be developed during the course of the project. In this context, applicants should consider aspects of accessibility and affordability of the solution, efficiency of the technology when implemented in the relevant contexts and how it contributes to health systems resilience. </span></p><p><span>This topic prioritises areas of health care such as health promotion, preparedness, prevention, surveillance and rapid response to cross-border health threats. Promoting coordination, cooperation and common standards in the procurement of innovation in health care (including emergency procurement) should be at the heart of any proposal submitted as well as facilitating the digital and green transition of EU health systems.</span></p><p><span>Activities covered should include cooperation with policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional national budgets for the PPI, searching support and collaborating with respective coordination and networking projects. Likewise, awareness raising, technical assistance and/or capacity building beyond the project to mainstream PPI implementation and removing obstacles for introducing the innovative solutions to be procured into the market could be included.</span></p><p><span>A wide variety of settings are potentially relevant for the implementation of such innovative solutions, for example primary health care settings, hospitals, specialised centres, and long-term health care facilities. The involvement of end-users and the use of cross-sectorial approaches are necessary in the area of health. They can lead to more impactful proposals, especially if combined with cost-effectiveness analyses in comparison with the status quo.</span></p><p><span>Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health care. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.</span></p><p><span>Synergies with the Technical Support Instrument</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup><span> and the European Structural and Investment Fund are encouraged.</span></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p>Social sciences and humanities<br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=InnovationProcurement;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Innovation Procurement</a><br>Digital Agenda<br>Artificial Intelligence<br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><span>Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 May 2020 on the establishment of the Technical Support Instrument, COM(2020) 409 final.</span></p>", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:&#xA;11.0pt;line-height:115%;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">1.
