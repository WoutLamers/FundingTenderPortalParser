The Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission, will support at least 100 cities in becoming climate neutral by 2030 and use these cities as innovation hubs for all cities to become climate neutral by 2050. Achieving this objective requires a systemic approach by the cities to reduce all GHG emissions, in particular in the mobility sector. </span></p><p><span>Public transport should continue to be the backbone of urban mobility, offer access and remain accessible at a reasonable cost. </span>Public transport concepts also need to consider and include the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, scooters etc. Urban public transport needs to be understood in a broad sense including peri-urban areas and commuter belt.<span> At the same time, Covid-19 and similar events can undermine trust between operators and passengers. Attractive, safe and secure mass transit accessibility is essential for cities that expect sprawl, population increase and economic growth. Public transport not only helps achieve environmental goals, but also plays a key role in the economy and job creation and in promoting territorial accessibility. In addition, public transport is intrinsic to the EU pillar of social rights as regards \u201cAccess to essential services\u201d. As such, it should cater to the widest possible array of user groups and their needs. <span>This includes persons irrespective of gender, age, disability, income, education level, and digital experience.</span> Moreover, where public transport is widely accessible, there is increased road safety.</span></p><p><span>The objective of this call is to increase the uptake of replicable public transport solutions in the living labs involved in the proposals while facilitating joint lesson-drawing and learning at European level. The funded actions will contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission and to the priorities of the European Green Deal, which stresses that \u201ctransport should become drastically less polluting, especially in cities. A combination of measures should address emissions, urban congestion and improved public transport<sup>\u201d</sup>.</span></p><p><span>New approaches and financing models are emerging. A secure, efficient, clean, reliable, attractive and affordable public transport is essential to address the variety of mobility needs. At the same time, it can become a silver bullet for reducing transport\u2019s negative externalities.</span></p><p><span>Projects should enhance the public transport share in the modal distribution by 30% compared to the baseline defined for each experimentation site at the start of the project and against which progress will be assessed.

Twinning cities can be from the same Member State or Associated Country as the lead cities.</span></span></span></span></p><p><span>Proposals should aim to improve the competitiveness of public transport by implementing in the living labs integrated, complementary and reinforcing packages of urban mobility measures.

Actions should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving the objectives set out by the topic, the local policy objectives should be evaluated against the baseline and the possible barriers to their broad take up, and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative. </span></p><p><span>Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative through the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined during the grant agreement phase. Collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative.
