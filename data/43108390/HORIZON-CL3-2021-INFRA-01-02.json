They provide the basis for our daily lives, connect people to each other and guarantee different kinds of social and economic interactions. To be able to allow for such interactions, be it in transport, communications or services, infrastructures has grown more complex to keep up with the development of modern societies, while at the same time ensuring their resilience against disasters and the impacts of climate change and other factors that affect society e.g. demographic changes. Infrastructures operate and function in a rapidly evolving socio-technological and threat environment with increasingly interconnected networks highly reliant upon one another, which presents both risks and opportunities for their protection. They must be resilient towards different expected and unexpected events, emerging risks, be they natural or man-made, unintentional, accidental or with malicious intent.</p><p>The <strong>Security Union Strategy</strong>[[COM(2020) 605 final.]] identifies the protection of critical infrastructures as one of the main priorities for the EU and its Member States for the coming years. Specific reference is established to growing interconnectivity as well as emerging and complex threats: technological trends like the use of Artificial Intelligence and the rapid development of sophisticated unmanned vehicles, the impact of natural and man-made disasters, as well as major crisis scenarios like the COVID-19 pandemic and unexpected events. Infrastructure preparedness and protection is a technologically complex domain, affected by various global developments and thus needs to be supported by targeted security research. This Work Programme aims at supporting the protection of European infrastructures with relevant projects, enabling public and private actors to meet current and emerging challenges.</p><p>Technologically complex applications offer the possibility for better prevention and preparedness, can enable efficient response to different threats and faster recovery. But at the same time, they create new vulnerabilities. The potential damage resulting from their disruption can escalate rapidly and negatively affect wider parts of vital societal functions. For instance, this is the case of satellite-based positioning and timing systems, which provide a wealth of high quality Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services that are exploited by critical infrastructures such as transport and logistics, energy grids, drinking water network, dams, telecom networks or financial markets. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) disruption or denial of services is recognised as an important economic and societal threat.</p><p>Infrastructures in the European Union are a high-value target for terrorist groups as well as agencies of third countries. With the <i>Directive on identification and designation of European critical infrastructures and assessment of the need to improve their protection</i>[[Directive (EU) 2008/114.]] the EU and its Member States have created a basis for a common approach towards protection. Under the umbrella of the new Security Union Strategy, the regulatory framework for critical infrastructure protection is currently under revision. The Proposal for additional measures on Critical Infrastructure Protection which is part of the European Commission work programme for 2020[[COM(2020) 440 final.<strong> </strong>]] is also making use of the significant results that security research has produced over the last decade.</p><p>Especially in the cyber-domain, the risks have been constantly growing in recent years, with both more frequent and more sophisticated attacks. In addition, criminals, and state-sponsored entities are utilising different tools for carrying out cyber-attacks on infrastructures with the help of cyber-tools for personal or political gain (e.g. extortion, blackmailing). The EU has acknowledged the strong role of the cyber dimension in infrastructure protection, most notably in the <i>Directive on security of network and information systems</i>[[Directive (EU) 2016/1148.]] and its revision, proposed in December 2020 [[COM(2020) 823 final.]] . Large-scale data mining of cross-sectoral information should be supported by targeted research on appropriate AI techniques and infrastructure. For instance for mission-critical systems it is essential to be able to react quickly, efficiently, safely and secure to different and complex scenarios enabling effective and informed decision-making based on sufficient available and trustworthy data.</p><p>Physical attacks are less frequent, but cases in the EUs neighbourhood have shown the destructive potential of new technologies used for attacks such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which can also be used for intentional disruptions that pose danger to safe operations of infrastructures and create significant economic losses.</p><p>Hybrid threats are of particular relevance in the overall risk scenarios, since they are designed to target vulnerabilities and aim in many cases at disrupting infrastructure and its services, making use of different methods. Hybrid threats, techniques and means encompass a combination of physical and cyber-attacks or disruptions, diplomatic, military and political as well as economic means. The effects of cyber-instruments and disinformation are crucial elements of such malevolent strategies and create the need for comprehensive preparedness to avoid large scale disruptions. As such, both the <i>Joint Framework on Countering Hybrid Threats</i> (2016)[[JOIN/2016/018 final.]] and the <i>Joint Communication on Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats</i> (2018)[[JOIN/2018/16 final.]] pay special attention to the role of infrastructures and state that research should provide better means to counter hybrid threats.</p><p>Europe is exposed to a wide range of natural hazards and the vulnerabilities of infrastructures need to be addressed also from that perspective. With certain disasters striking more frequently and more severely, as well as long-term challenges such as climate change, there is a need to deploy innovative solutions to ensure the continuous functioning of European infrastructures exposed to such natural extremes. Security research should in this regard support the regulatory and cooperation measures at European level, such as the <i>Union Civil Protection Mechanism</i>[[<i>Decision No 1313/2013/EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism and subsequent amendments</i>.]]<i> </i>and the new <i>EU Adaptation Strategy</i>. On the other hand, new infrastructures technologies themselves (for example energy production and storages, new materials, water protection, etc.) can pose a potential risks for society due to accidents. Therefore, the role of civil protection needs to be reflected in targeted research at the same level as it is the case for different security authorities.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis presents a challenge that is unprecedented in recent European history and it concerns infrastructures in two main dimensions. Pandemics are an extreme stress-test for the function of certain infrastructures (most notably: health, transport and supply-chains) by disrupting established procedures, threatening the function due to infection of workforces and massively scaling up the need for resources. In addition, infrastructures themselves can increase pandemic risk if unsuited to different mitigation measures and promoting virus transmission. This area will build on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis. It will be for certain topics essential also to ensure synergies and coordination of actions with the Health Programme [[Regulation (EU) 2021/522 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 March 2021 establishing a Programme for the Union\u2019s action in the field of health (\u2018EU4Health Programme\u2019) for the period 2021-2027, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 282/2014.]].</p><p>Increased complexity in the area of infrastructure protection is not only related to the amplified role of the cyber dimension, but also by the mix of man-made and natural hazards and the growing interdependence. The development of European cities into smart cities has opened up a new domain in infrastructure protection, expanding the perspective beyond classical sectors of (critical) infrastructure since more complex, connected and vulnerable assets are deployed in urban areas. This consideration unveils the still fragile building blocks of smart cities\u2019 technological features and underlines the need to put a stronger emphasis on broader societal challenges and needs. Security research can help to make use of the knowledge acquired in other sectors and to make it usable for local authorities to protect and empowers people and assets in cities and urban areas.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to primarily make use of Copernicus data, services and technologies.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:<i>\u201c[\u2026] resilience and autonomy of physical and digital infrastructures are enhanced and vital societal functions are ensured, thanks to more powerful prevention, preparedness and response, a better understanding of related human, societal and technological aspects, and the development of cutting-edge capabilities for [\u2026] infrastructure operators [\u2026]\u201d</i></p><p>More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Ensured resilience of large-scale interconnected systems infrastructures in case of complex attacks, pandemics or natural and man-made disasters;</li><li>Upgraded infrastructure protection systems enable rapid, effective, safe and secure response and without substantial human intervention to complex threats and challenges, and better assess risks ensuring resilience and strategic autonomy of European infrastructures;</li><li>Resilient and secure smart cities are protected using the knowledge derived from the protection of critical infrastructures and systems that are characterised by growing complexity.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Resilient Infrastructure", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["staff safety", "critical supplies", "cyber risks", "crisis", "pandemics", "disruption", "infrastructure resilience", "cyber attacks", "cross-border", "infectious disease", "healthcare"], "keywords": ["First responders", "Infectious diseases", "Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)", "Crisis management operations", "Water and power distribution", "International Cooperation", "Healthcare system", "Protection of networks", "Disaster resilience and crisis management", "Security"], "flags": ["EC-WORLD"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "30 June 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["23 November 2021"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3347962": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL3-2021-INFRA-01-02 - HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "plannedOpeningDate": "30 June 2021", "deadlineModel": "single-stage", "deadlineDates": ["23 November 2021"], "budgetYearMap": {"2021": 20000000}, "budgetTopicActionMap": {}}, {"action": "HORIZON-CL3-2021-INFRA-01-01 - HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "plannedOpeningDate": "30 June 2021", "deadlineModel": "single-stage", "deadlineDates": ["23 November 2021"], "budgetYearMap": {"2021": 20000000}, "budgetTopicActionMap": {}}]}, "budgetYearsColumns": ["2021"]}, "description": "<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">ExpectedOutcome</SPAN>:<p><span>Projects are expected to contribute to some or all of the following expected outcomes:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Strategies for the resilience of infrastructure networks and services, and their interaction and vulnerabilities in a context of rapidly changing volumes and patterns of use</span></li><li><span>Understanding of inter-dependencies and strategies to overcome disruptions at local \u2013 regional \u2013 national and European (cross-border) level</span></li><li><span>Better understanding of the cascading effects of pandemics for different infrastructures and the services they provide</span></li><li>Improved procedures to reduce exposure of workforce to infectious diseases and mitigation strategies in case of the infrastructure disruptions or overload caused by the absence of critical workforce, surge of patients in the healthcare services, or disruptions of critical supplies</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p><span>Pandemics such as the COVID-19 crisis and other health risks have the potential to massively disrupt the functioning of infrastructures and vital societal functions. While this is most evident for the health system, the negative impacts reach much further. </span><span style=\"color:#2E2E2E;\">Resilient infrastructure systems particularly \u2018lifeline\u2019 services such as electric power, water and health care are critical for minimizing the societal impact of extreme events.</span><span> It is essential to develop targeted solutions to ensure continuity of operations of different services and supplies, which are also critical to allow for prevention, preparedness and response to pandemics. This preparedness must also account for climate change as a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d, for example with heatwaves, storms, forest fires or flooding either accelerating the spread of a pandemic or rendering countermeasures like confinement less effective.</span></p><p><span>Member States remain the primary actors in preventing and responding to the outbreaks of infectious diseases. Enhanced European coordination into capacity-building, improved prevention, preparedness and coordinated response can support their efforts. In order to improve the EU-wide prevention and response to the specific challenges for the functioning of infrastructure in case of a severe infectious disease crises requires targeted security research which can deliver better knowledge, security risk assessment as well preparedness and response emergency planning tools. Public-private cooperation is absolutely essential in order to respond to a crisis as far reaching as a pandemic. Any comprehensive European approach to infrastructure resilience in case of a disruption caused by it, will need to take due account of this cooperation.</span></p><p><span>In infrastructure protection research, it is of high importance to understand the impact of the pandemic beyond the directly affected health system. The availability of specialised work force and vulnerability assessment of health capacities constitute the essential elements in this regard, as disruption of infrastructures due to the infection of large parts of a specific work force poses the immediate risk of cascading effects. The same is the case for integrated supply-chains for both critical goods, as well as non-essential ones. As such, understanding interdependencies, reducing vulnerabilities and identifying truly critical activities is key for enhancing overall societal resilience against pandemics.</span></p><p><span>A situation like the COVID-19 crisis, also puts the capacities of different infrastructures under exceptional stress, due to the rapidly increased demand for certain supplies and services and the ensuring change of load stress of different networks (as for example sudden increase in communication, decrease in transport, ensuring essential resources). Such changes in use-patterns open vulnerabilities, as for example increased cyber-risks in the event of teleworking or less physical protection due to staff contingency measures. Design of some critical infrastructure components, such as transport networks and critical manufacturing may in themselves be resilient to the pandemic threat, but put overall societal resilience at risk by promoting disease transmission and being unsuited to different mitigation measures. </span></p><p><span><span>The testing and/or piloting of the strategies developed in a real setting with one or more relevant public authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across </span></span><span><span>setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. \u2013 to be developed by the project.</span></span></p><p><span>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is advised. </span></p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Topic Conditions</SPAN>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-7 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B.</p></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=EC-WORLD;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International Cooperation</a><br></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%;&#10;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&#10;Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;&#10;color:#404040;mso-themecolor:text1;mso-themetint:191;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;&#10;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">1.
