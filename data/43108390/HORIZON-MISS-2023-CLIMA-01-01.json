The <strong>Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, </strong>will enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. Its implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the mission \u201c<strong>Adaptation to Climate Change</strong>\u201d[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf</a>]].</p><p>Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission has set out concrete objectives and deliver tangible solutions, mainstreaming nature-based approaches, to Europeans. The work supported by the Mission will also be of particular relevance to the forthcoming Nature Restoration Law, that will set targets to restore degraded ecosystems.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as EU Member States, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong>.</p><p>By supporting European regions, local authorities and communities to become <strong>climate resilient</strong>, the Mission will help them to be prepared for inevitable changes and extreme events.</p><p>While some regions, and cities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. Less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity will receive particular attention. The Mission approach is to ask front-runners European regions to share their experience and lessons learnt with others and accompany them in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and economy.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions capable to address one or more of the systems locally identified as key for climate resilience building and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would be ideally part of the adaptation roadmaps locally developed to address the identified climate risks, and in line with the National Adaptation Plan and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, being them the citizens, the businesses and /or the social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will assure to maintain the solutions in place for the future, beyond the implementation duration of the project. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake. As foreseen under the Horizon Europe Regulation, the Mission will follow a portfolio approach in its related calls, in that \u201cthe evaluation committee shall rank the proposals that have passed the applicable thresholds, according to: (a) the evaluation scores; (b) their contribution to the achievement of specific policy objectives, including the constitution of a consistent portfolio of projects. In particular, the Mission calls will foster the development of a balanced portfolio of solutions across the different climate risks, the different innovation areas as identified in the Mission Implementation Plan and the different biogeographical regions, as defined by the European Environment Agency.</p>", "missionDescription": "Mission: Adaptation to climate change (2023/24)", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["smart farming", "ecosystems restoration", "build climate resilience", "climate resilience", "agriculture systems", "innovative solutions", "innovative solutions for climate resilience", "systemic approach", "transformative change"], "keywords": ["Forest adaptation to climate change", "Agroecology", "Forestry", "Forest resilience", "Ecosystem services provided by soils", "Climatic research", "Ecosystem management", "Climatology and climate change", "Nature-based solutions", "Social Innovation", "Habitat and species restoration and rehabilitation", "Agriculture, Rural Development, Fisheries", "Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries", "Forest ecosystem services", "Fight against threats to the Environment", "Climate change adaptation", "EOSC and FAIR data", "Green and blue infrastructure"], "flags": ["SocInnov", "EoscAndFairData"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "10 January 2023", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["20 September 2023"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3488325": [{"action": "HORIZON-MISS-2023-CLIMA-01-03 -

Nature based solutions<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> and the restoration of cropland and grassland should be explored as priority and at the very heart of the development whenever possible.</p><p>The proposed solution should address at least some of the following aspects:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Improving resilience of the <strong>agriculture and /or forestry sector</strong>, improving the capacity of the sector to withstand dry periods and extreme droughts while protecting the ecological flows, preserving biodiversity in and around the catchment channels, preserving longitudinal connectivity of the flowing streams, slowing the falling level of the groundwater table and reversing the loss of biodiversity. This should include for example exploring value of culture rotation and other means to improve soil quality, improving soil structure by circular approaches, establishment and maintenance of landscape features (such as hedges reducing wind erosion), innovative silvo-pasture, management of genetic resources in an agro-ecological perspective and other agro-ecology approaches in farmland, in particular in relation to droughts and water multi-usage and management;</li><li>Exploiting <strong>agro-ecology </strong>as an approach to enhance the climate resilience of the farming system, its functionality and sustainability, while bringing sustainable solutions and multiple benefits, such as more stable yields from adapted food crops, water efficiency, enhanced farmer livelihoods from income generation, increased biodiversity, improved water quality and water use efficiency, the ecological status of waters, improved soil structure and health, reduced erosion, and/or a higher level of carbon sequestration.<strong> </strong></li><li>Exploring integration of<strong> </strong>available <strong>smart farming</strong> approaches (and improvements of the same based on updated data) and the use of technologies such as the AI, remote sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve climate resilience through the modification and improvement of nutrient and crop protection processes, such as fertilization, pest control and irrigation, to ensure sufficient crop yields both in terms of quality and quantity, while also reducing emissions, water consumption and preserving biodiversity.</li><li>Development of <strong>more natural ecosystems</strong>, generating combined benefits for climate mitigation, reduction of water flooding and soil erosion, (by increasing green infrastructures, tree planting, or increasing of permeable green surfaces) and maintaining or restoring rivers, peatland, wetland and natural floodplain.</li><li>Further demonstrate and increase awareness of the <strong>value of maintaining and restoring existing natural systems, </strong>preservation of cultural landscapes and socio-ecological systems as providing a rich spectrum of climate services compared to other anthropogenic solutions, including integration of cultural heritage considerations as the legacy from the past, to be experienced in the present, and for transmitting to future generations. In line with the Mission Implementation Plan and the new EU Climate Adaptation Strategy, implementing nature-based solutions with adequate social and environmental standards on a larger scale would increase climate resilience. Blue-green (as opposed to grey) infrastructures represent multipurpose, \u201cno regret\u201d solutions, which simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build climate resilience, whose uptake can be facilitated by better quantification and communication of their benefits. Nature based Solutions (NBS) essential role for sustaining healthy water, oceans and soils was recognised, together with their potential to reduce costs, provide climate-resilient services, and improve compliance with Water Framework Directive requirement for good ecological status, if they were to play a bigger role in land-use management and infrastructure planning. The forthcoming Nature Restoration Law will also play an important role in requiring MS to plan restoration activities across a range of ecosystems. </li> </ul><p>As climate impacts, adaptive capacities and disaster risk reduction capabilities differ greatly across regions, the proposed development and innovation should address specific needs identified <strong>at regional and local scale </strong>(both at the rural, urban-rural interface and eventually in urban context) with tailor-made responses and measures<strong>,</strong> fully acknowledging place-based governance, socio-economic and identity characteristics and other place-based data.</p><p>In line with the Mission objective to <strong>build systemic climate resilience</strong>, the proposal should address the <strong>multi-risks locally identified</strong>, design and implement a systemic solution to reduce the identified vulnerabilities of the agriculture and/or forestry sector to climate change and to mitigate its negative potential impacts.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged. To this purpose, the proposals <strong>must include at least 4 demonstrations taking place in different regions/local authorities/ communities</strong>, which should collaborate in addressing the common climate change challenges identified and in testing the most suitable solutions. These at least 4 demonstrations must be <strong>located in at least 3 different EU Member States and/ or Horizon Europe associated countries. </strong>Involvement in the proposal of regions eligible for Cohesion funds<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> to conduct at least one of the proposed demonstrations shall be regarded as a positive element.</p><p>The proposals should clearly identify the biogeographical area, for which the proposed solution is relevant and to which the proposal is focussed. Moreover, the proposal should explore possible <strong>reapplication to other regions</strong>, starting from those located in the same biogeographical areas.</p><p>To support a large impact, the proposed solutions should be widely re-applicable. To this purpose, identification and inclusion of <strong>at least three \u201creplicating\u201d regions/local authorities/communities</strong>, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is strongly encouraged; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the \u201creplicating\u201d regions.</p><p>In addition to the local/regional authorities owning the climate challenge, the consortium may include other type of partners, such as private or public research organisations, enterprises and NGOs, to ensure that all needed capabilities are available to develop and implement real life actions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond the EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by European and national programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Moreover, proposals should look into opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across in Europe in particular through the LIFE programme and its integrated projects, and through the European Regional Development Fund programmes.</p><p>The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic adaptation solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, should contribute to this topic and the proposal should build on the activities of the EIT Climate-KIC or EIT Food.</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links with the Climate-ADAPT platform (run by the European Environment Agency (EEA) together with DG CLIMA) that will act as a central element for the monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in European Regions. To this purpose, projects will feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in the Mission Community of Practice that will be established amongst the Mission Charter signatories and and in <strong>networking and joint activities</strong> with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Climate Adaptation as well as in other relevant Missions and partnerships, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. Beyond the Mission, the projects funded under this topic are also encouraged to exchange and identify cooperation opportunities with other projects funded under Horizon Europe, in particular those funded under Cluster 6, the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe and the future partnership on agro-ecology living labs.</p><p>The European Commission intends to establish a network and coordination activities amongst all the projects funded for the implementation of the Climate adaptation Mission, under the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call and under Horizon Europe, and that will be coordinated by the soon to be established Mission Implementation Platform.
