Fostering enabling innovation ecosystems across the European Union (EU) requires a systemic approach that is inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and places, maximises the value of innovation to all, and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits.</p><p>As highlighted in the European Commission Communication on a New European Innovation Agenda[[<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52022DC0332\">A New European Innovation Agenda, COM(2022) 332 final</a>]], by increasing the inclusion and interconnection of less represented regions and actors into a more strongly integrated European ecosystem, the EU can capitalise on the experience, needs, visions, and perceptions of an increasingly diverse range of people, companies and places. In doing so, it can also take forward a uniquely inclusive European innovation model that is sustainable, guards against substantial labour market and wage gaps, and associated threats to territorial and social cohesion.</p><p>Moreover, such well-connected and diverse ecosystems provide innovative companies with the necessary support and conditions to thrive, i.e. through additional capabilities, data, customers, knowledge, and talents. Network connectivity within and between innovation ecosystems greatly contributes to sustainable business growth with high societal value. Therefore, the actions of this destination aim at strengthening and expanding cooperation between innovation players to better support the next generation of innovative companies whose solutions will lead the shift towards a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world.</p><p>Besides stronger innovation performance, increased competitive sustainability, and more rapid transitions to a green and digital society, ecosystem integration can provide ecosystem actors and companies with access to new resource, markets, customers, and contribute to disruptive strategies and innovative solutions. By being actively engaged in their local, regional, national, and European networks, companies can increase their overall growth potential.</p><p>This destination offers a holistic package of actions that:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Strengthen innovation ecosystems across the EU through fostering more efficient, inclusive, gender diverse, and connected innovation ecosystems, by accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech[[Deep tech innovation aims to provide concrete solutions to our societal problems by finding its source in a deep interaction with the most recent scientific and technological advances and by seeking to produce a profound impact in the targeted application areas.]] innovation and encouraging co-planning, co-implementation, and co-investments around European strategic priority areas;</li><li>Ensure the inclusion of all key innovation players from across the quadruple helix,[[A model of cooperation between industry, academia, civil society and public authorities, with a strong emphasis on citizens and their needs.]], and all EU territories, including rural areas[[<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/strategy/strategy_documents/documents/ltvra-c2021-345_en.pdf\">Long-term vision for the EU\u2019s Rural areas </a><a href=\"http://eit.europa.eu/our-activities/eit-regional-innovation-scheme\">(COM(2021)345 final.</a>]];</li><li>Mobilise policies, funding instruments (EU, national, regional) and fostering synergies between them;</li><li>Improve public and private buyers\u2019 capacity to procure innovative solutions and enhance coordination on innovation procurement initiatives within Member States and Associated Countries;</li><li>Improve the connection of individual innovators with other ecosystem actors and innovation support providers;</li><li>Ensure openness and cross-fertilisation of the innovation ecosystem within and beyond the EU's borders.</li> </ul><p>In particular, the actions under this destination should promote the creation of links:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Between all key innovation stakeholders, including the private sector, in particular between SMEs, start-ups and other innovators, including social innovators with investors, industry and public and/or private buyers for faster access to funds and markets and the public sector including authorities in charge of national, regional or local innovation policies and programmes and bodies responsible for smart specialisation strategies;
