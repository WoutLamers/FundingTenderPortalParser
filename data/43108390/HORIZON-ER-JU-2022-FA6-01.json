Hence, having an essential function as green transport and connecting other public transport services (e.g. bus) as well as first &amp; last mile services such as car, bike sharing, cycling, walking from railway stations to remote locations. However, these railway lines need to be revitalized or even regenerated to make them economically, socially and environmentally sustainable and meet the current customer needs. The overall objective is to ensure long term viability of regional railways by decreasing the total cost of ownership, in other words, cost per kilometre both in terms of OPEX and CAPEX, while offering a high quality of service and operational safety as well as better customer satisfaction.</p><p>These goals are expected to be achieved through a concept tailored to regional railways that includes digitalisation, automation and utilisation of mainstream and emerging technologies for signalling and trackside components, rolling stock and customer information.</p><p>The outcome and demonstrated solutions shall not only be applicable for specific lines or regions but be adequately scalable and interoperable to become a European solution. Furthermore, proposed solutions and technologies could be applied to provide a more cost-efficient infrastructure in other settings.
