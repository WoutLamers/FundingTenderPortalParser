In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.</p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission Label</strong></p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts (CCC)</strong> are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission \u201c100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030\u201d. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it \u2013 the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.</p><p>As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a <strong>Mission Label</strong> \u201cto the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC\u201d. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.</p><p>A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#documents\">Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)</a></p><p>]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: <strong>the Main Commitment Part</strong> which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; <strong>the Climate Neutral Action Plan</strong> which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the <strong>Climate</strong> <strong>Neutrality Investment Plan</strong> which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.</p><p>The Mission Platform will undertake a <strong>completeness check</strong> where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the <strong>co-creation process</strong> in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the <strong>Climate Neutrality Action Plan</strong> and the <strong>Climate Neutrality Investment Plan</strong>.</p><p>After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.</p><p>The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the <strong>consultation of the Mission Board</strong> and <strong>recommendation from the Mission Owners Group,</strong> the Mission Manager will decide whether to <strong>endorse</strong> the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.</p><p><strong>Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work Programme</strong></p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a> to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">UN Agenda 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">EU Zero Pollution Action Plan</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">Fit for 55 strategy</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en\">EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en\">the EU Industrial Strategy</a><u>, the </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/bioeconomy/bioeconomy-strategy_en\">EU Bioeconomy Strategy</a> and the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">New European Bauhaus initiative</a>. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.</p><p>Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&amp;I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);</li><li>engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;</li><li>developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. </li><li>rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;</li><li>delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;</li><li>exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;</li><li>fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability.</li> </ul><p>The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en</a>]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.</p><p>Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.</p><p>Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&amp;I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.</p><p>Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.</p><p>The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.</p><p>In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.</p><p>Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically,

They are the interface between rural and urban environments and are often the subject of high pressure from the urban core which results in an un-controlled and uneven urban expansion towards the rural territory often triggering environmental degradation. While dispersed and heterogenous in terms of land-occupancy, density and services and amenities distribution, the peri-urban territory integrates mutual inter-dependences within the urban-rural continuum. These can be associated with people (inwards and outwards migration or socio-demographic change) as well as with linkages and flows between a variety of rural and urban related functions and activities (ranging from industrial and recycling manufacturing, agriculture production and food processing, sanitation, waste disposal, drinking water provisions, to housing \u2013 including slums and gated communities \u2013 transport and associated infrastructure, large-scale commercial sites, and large recreational areas such as parks or forests), which juxtapose, collide and mesh in unintended and unplanned ways.</p><p>Peri-urban areas are also the subject of weaker governance structures and limited institutional capacity, which in return limits the capacity to regulate economic activities and land-use and land coverage and makes it difficult to implement effective and integrated local, regional, and functional urban area wide policies and programs. This is particularly challenging in areas that straddle multiple jurisdictions, such as urban-rural fringe.</p><p>This topic aims to foster the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within the current peri-urban development and planning practice to reduce these areas GHG emissions and to improve their liveability.</p><p>Proposals, depending on chosen domains, should investigate a sustainable and decarbonised development of the peri-urban areas by shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources in mobility, energy or industry domains supported by adequate governance structures and practices based on a sustainable land-use planning and an urban expansion which integrates environmental considerations and determinants. In addition, proposals should provide European demonstration-type examples on how to sustainably integrate climate-neutral, green, and smart solutions and measures into the peri-urban/urban development and the existing transport, energy, and industrial infrastructures, to achieve long-term decarbonization impacts and necessary climate resilience. Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project. Positive, long-term impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and public perception \u2013 resulting in behavioural change and policy change \u2013 should be fostered and anticipated. Proposals, depending on selected domains should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Explore particular characteristics of peri-urban areas that are distinct from rural and urban ones and analyse relevant urban-rural dynamics such as continuous and frequent land-use and functional changes, poor and inaccessible transport infrastructure, scattered and unevenly distributed day-to-day services and amenities.</li><li>Explore models of urban/peri-urban development and planning containing the above-mentioned dynamics (e.g., expansion model, densification model, green-belts and green-corridors model) aimed at overcoming the sustainability, decarbonisation and local climate (e.g. heat islands) challenges of the urban-rural fringe while ensuring co-creation with and engagement of the relevant stakeholders (including citizens and communities).</li><li>Focus on domains that are particularly pertinent in achieving progress in sustainable development, such as:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Mobility and transport with extensive use of personal cars with combustion engines, poor and scattered infrastructure, and lack of sustainable transport options. Transport related emissions that are exacerbated by intensive commuter flows generated by peri-urban areas. City focused solutions that are not adapted to peri-urban areas and challenges often exceeding organizational, financial and knowledge capacities of local authorities. Proposals should analyse and explore how peri-urban generated traffic impacts the transport flows (for both goods and people) and its contribution to the total CO2/emissions of the entire urbanized territory.</li><li>Industry, accounting for 30% of CO2 emissions and often located in peri-urban areas, is capital in succeeding the transition towards a net zero economy. Proposals should analyse the contribution to the total emissions reduction, of improved energy efficiency measures in industrial processes located in peri-urban areas, as well as of the deployment of strategic net-zero technologies, such as solar, (PV and thermal), wind, hydrogen, batteries and storage (incl. thermal energy storage), heat pumps and geothermal energy, electrolysers and fuel cells, biogas/biomethane, carbon capture and storage, and grid technologies, as envisaged in the EU Net Zero Industry Act. Proposals should ramp up and facilitate public-private partnerships, notably the key role of Local Green Deals (LGDs).</li><li>Circular economy: Peri-urban areas are key for setting up recycling facilities for materials, products and equipment and scaling up material reuse, such as Social Urban Mining and recycling infrastructure across different industries (e.g., online marketplaces to empower exchange for materials, or physical Materials Banks for construction and demolition materials). Proposals should explore, analyse and facilitate the deployment of innovative industrial recycling processes, industrial symbiosis and closed-loop systems, as well as supporting knowledge transfer through innovative practices; piloting local platforms for Social Urban Mining<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>; demonstrating recycling and re-use processes for building and public works materials, industrial waste, water and waste management; enabling material reuse; inducing circular practices, reuse of materials and behavioural change.</li><li>Vulnerability of peri-urban areas to environmental damage as most of the urban wastes (solid and liquid) and pollutant activities are pushed in the peripheries.</li><li>Electricity grids and heating/cooling solutions are suboptimal in some peri-urban areas. The often-low energy efficiency and individual fossil fuel or even solid fuel-based heating of the building stock exacerbates energy poverty in the absence of sufficient population density for district heating while the lower real estate prices hamper deep renovation. The opportunities of available space for i.e., clean energy production or electricity and thermal storage are not sufficiently exploited to increase living comfort, accelerate energy transition for the benefit of the local economy and nearby urban areas.</li><li>Governance, as peri-urban areas can be beyond the legal authority of cities, nor are they considered as part of the rural administrative units. Therefore, the capacity to regulate economic activities (and thus land-use and land coverage) is weak. This results in the peri-urbanization being largely an unplanned process, informal and sometime illegal and often resulting in environmental hazards and degradation of natural resources. This also results in a scattered and uneven distribution of services, amenities, and resources across the peri-urban area. The weaker governance structures complicate also integrated planning and green procurement of energy, transport, and other services.</li><li>Social and cultural characteristics of peri-urban areas that are gaining on heterogeneity with continuous social dynamics. In many (Central and Eastern) EU cities the peri-urban expansion was driven by the emergence of a stronger middle class. However, in more recent years there has been an increasingly heterogenous mix of occupants/actors with multiple and most often conflicting interests, including settled populations, populations living in gated estates, in-migrants, transient workers, emerging middle-class among others. This overall leads to heterogeneous communities and, in general, to a lack of social cohesion.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p>The research actions should cover the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way, and provide a summary of measures contributing to climate neutrality in European peri-urban areas, identifying barriers.</li><li>Establish co-designing process and engaging with the relevant stakeholders (such as: citizens, local authorities, mobility operators, service providers, energy companies, private businesses\u2026) to ensure a successful uptake of solutions contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li><li>Develop, test, and demonstrate scalable solutions in real life in at least two out of the four domains (Mobility, Energy, Industry, Governance) contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li> </ul><p>Each proposal should involve stakeholders from at least three \u2018lead urban/peri-urban areas\u2019, and at least three \u2018replicator\u2019 urban/peri-urban areas. Each urban/peri-urban area should establish a living laboratory where, under real life-conditions, a set of complementary and reinforcing solutions, centred on two to four aspects from the ones presented above (mobility, energy, industry, and governance) should be developed, tested, and implemented in an integrated approach. The participating urban/peri-urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests, and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. The peri-urban areas should each be situated in different EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe. Each proposal should at least include one urban area of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities.</p><p>To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects\u2019 outcomes, proposals are expected to provide measurable indicators to demonstrate how the tested solutions are contributing to the climate neutrality objectives of the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission and participating peri-urban areas. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets, and appropriate review processes for each participating urban area. The baselines for the expected outcomes should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation.</p><p>Projects are expected to collaborate with the established and widely applied process and impact evaluation framework (using both clear baselines and measurable impact indicators) as well as the corporate design, the dissemination and information exchange frameworks put in place by the Commission (e.g. the Mission Platform, the CIVITAS initiative, Scalable cities, New European Bauhaus Community, the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, etc.) and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the EIT, such as, for example, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Culture and Creativity or EIT Food, EU Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, and Driving Urban Transitions Partnership (DUT), depending on the area. They shall contribute to the development of the existing European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts resulting from the implementation of innovative, sustainable, green, and inclusive solutions in urban areas.</p><p>Clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take-up during and beyond the project are expected, which could, for example, be in the form of follow-up actions funded by CEF, ELENA, or similar programmes.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Inclusiveness of vulnerable populations (older people, children) as well as gender perspectives should be considered.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><sup> </sup>Social Urban Mining \u2013 is the concept of creating extended value of demolished buildings by optimizing the deconstruction phase through re-use and high-value recycling.
