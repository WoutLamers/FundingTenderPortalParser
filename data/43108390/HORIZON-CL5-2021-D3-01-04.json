In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS).</p><p>The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral. R&amp;I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&amp;I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&amp;I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&amp;I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.</p><p>This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan\u2019s <strong>Key Strategic Orientations (KSO)</strong>:</p><ul><li><i>C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;</i></li><li><i>A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy</i>[[<i>\u2018Open strategic autonomy\u2019 refers to the term \u2018strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy\u2019, as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 \u2013 2 October 2020.</i>]]<i> by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;</i></li></ul><p>It covers the following <strong>impact areas</strong>:</p><ul><li>Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;</li><li>Affordable and clean energy.</li></ul><p>The <strong>expected impact</strong>, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to <i>\u201cMore efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions\u201d</i>, notably through</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman;\"><li>Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable <strong>renewable energy technologies</strong> and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).</li><li>Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply.

Their large scale and decentralised deployment is expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a sustainable European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies, coupled with circularity and sustainability, will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics or bioenergy), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost efficient option.</p><p>Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are possible for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities.</p><p>In line with the \u201cdo not harm\u201d principle for the environment, actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution and ecosystems. In particular, for biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other parts of the WP.</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting the renewable energy technologies and solutions under this Destination are:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\"><li>Availability of disruptive renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies and systems in 2050 in order to accelerate the replacement of fossil-based energy technologies.</li><li>Reduced cost and improved efficiency of renewable energy and renewable fuel technologies and their value chains.</li><li>De-risking of renewable energy and fuel technologies with a view to their commercial exploitation and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</li><li>Better integration of renewable energy and renewable fuel-based solutions in energy consuming sectors.</li><li>Reinforced European scientific basis and European export potential for renewable energy technologies through international collaboration (notably with Africa in renewable energy technologies and renewable fuels and enhanced collaboration with Mission Innovation countries).</li><li>Enhanced sustainability of renewable energy and renewable fuels value chains, taking fully into account social, economic and environmental aspects in line with the European Green Deal priorities.</li><li>More effective market uptake of renewable energy and fuel technologies.</li></ol><p><i><strong><u>Energy systems, grids and storage</u></strong></i></p><p>Efficient and effective network management is the key to the integration of renewables in an efficient way that ensures cost-effectiveness and affordability, security of supply and grid stability. Real time monitoring and optimisation are necessary to increase the flexibility, through solutions such as storage, demand response or flexible generation among others, to integrate higher shares of variable renewable energy. Exploiting synergies between electricity, heating and cooling networks, gas networks, transport infrastructure and digital infrastructure will be crucial for enabling the smart, integrated, flexible, green and sustainable operation of the relevant infrastructures. Besides hydrogen and batteries (addressed elsewhere), R&amp;I in other storage technologies, in particular thermal storage but also electrochemical, chemical, mechanical and electrical storage solutions is necessary to create a set of flexibility options.</p><p>Activities on energy systems, grids and storage under this Destination will primarily focus on the systemic aspects to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the system, in particular: integrated energy system planning and operation, engaging consumers and providing new services, electricity system reliability and resilience, storage development and integration and green digitalisation of the energy system.</p><p>Moreover, the role of citizens and communities is key when it comes to making the flexibility at appliance level available for the grid. Related to this, the inclusion of social sciences and humanities (SSH) where relevant is essential to build the social acceptance of new energy technologies and increase participation of consumers in energy markets.</p><p>All projects will contribute to an increased capacity of the system to integrate renewable energy sources and less curtailment at transmission and distribution level. The main expected impacts are:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\"><li>Increased resilience of the energy system based on improved and/or new technologies to control the system and maintain system stability under difficult circumstances.</li><li>Increased flexibility and resilience of the energy system, based on technologies and tools to plan and operate different networks for different energy carriers simultaneously in a coordinated manner that will also contribute to climate neutrality of hard-to-electrify sectors.</li><li>Enhance consumer satisfaction and increased system flexibility thanks to enabling consumers to benefit from data-driven energy services and facilitating their investment and engagement in the energy transition, through self-consumption, demand response or joint investments in renewables (either individually or through energy communities or micro-grids).</li><li>Improved energy storage technologies, in particular heat storage but also others such as electrochemical, chemical, mechanical and electrical.</li><li>Foster the European market for new energy services and business models as well as tested standardised and open interfaces of energy devices through a higher degree of interoperability, increased data availability and easier data exchange among energy companies as well as companies using energy system data.</li><li>More effective and efficient solutions for transporting off-shore energy thanks to new electricity transmission technologies, in particular using superconducting technologies, power electronics and hybrid Alternate Current \u2013 Direct Current grid solutions as well as MT HVDC (Multi Terminal High Voltage Direct Current) solutions.</li></ol><p><span style=\"color:rgb(13,13,13);\"><i><strong><u>Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)</u></strong></i></span></p><p>CCUS will play a crucial role in the EU Green Deal for the transition of energy-intensive industries and the power sector towards climate neutrality. Supporting R&amp;I for CCUS will be particularly important in those industries where other alternatives do not yet exist like the cement industry. This will be highly relevant towards 2050, when most electricity will be coming from renewables, but the need to tackle the process emissions from industry will continue. If CCUS is combined with sustainable biomass, it could create negative emissions.</p><p>Low carbon hydrogen from natural gas with CCUS could also play a significant role in industrial climate neutrality, in the transition towards full use of hydrogen from renewable sources, in particular in industries such as steel making, chemicals, or refining where large quantities of hydrogen are needed. CCUS would enable early, clean hydrogen at scale. The hydrogen infrastructure built for clean hydrogen with CCUS could be also shared by hydrogen from renewable sources. It is thus important to develop CCUS for industrial clusters, including aspects of system planning, shared infrastructure solutions such as buffer storage, shared CO2 and hydrogen transportation and infrastructure optimisation for CCS and CCU.</p><p>Demonstration of the full CCUS chain is needed in the EU, with special emphasis on the reduction of the energy penalty and cost of capture and on ascertaining safe storage. Under the EU Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) ambitious R&amp;I targets have been set in agreement with the sectorial stakeholders. The focus is on CO2 storage appraisal, cost-reductions, new technologies and proliferation of pilots and demonstrators.</p><p>Synergies with cluster 4 exist on the use of CO2 (please see topic \u201cHORIZON-CL4-2022-TWIN-TRANSITION-01-11: Valorisation of CO/ CO2 streams into added-value products of market interest (IA)\u201d).</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting the renewable energy technologies and solutions under this Destination are:</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\"><li>Accelerated rollout of infrastructure for CCUS hubs and clusters.</li><li>Updated authoritative body of knowledge on connecting industrial CO2 sources with potential \u2018bankable storage sites, providing greater confidence for decision makers and investors.</li><li>Proven feasibility of integrating CO2 capture, CO2 storage and CO2 use in industrial facilities. Demonstrating these technologies at industrial scale shall pave the way for subsequent first-of-a-kind industrial projects.</li><li>Reduced cost of the CCUS value chain, with CO2 capture being still the most relevant stumbling block for a wider application of CCUS.</li><li>Adequate frameworks for Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) for storage projects, to document safe storage and for public acceptance of the technology.</li></ol>", "destinationDescription": "Sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply", "topicMGAs": [], "keywords": ["Energy, fuels and petroleum engineering", "International Cooperation"], "flags": ["EC-WORLD"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-COFUND HORIZON Programme Cofund Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "24 June 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["20 October 2021"]}], "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Oct 19, 2021 12:23:32 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 19, 2021 12:23:32 PM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><font color=\"#1f497d\"><i>UPDATE: P</i></font><i><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"color:#1F497D;mso-ansi-language:&#10;EN-GB\">lease note that the deadline for the call&nbsp;HORIZON-CL5-2021-D3-01 has been extended for 24 hours.

To decarbonise Europe, renewables must become the main energy source, while keeping the stability and resilience of the European energy system. Research and Innovation is needed to be able to achieve the Clean Energy Transition, while realizing also the ambitions of other EU policies like the New Circular Economy Strategy and the new Biodiversity Strategy and delivering on the objectives of the European Green Deal. It will also contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (in particular SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). At national level, policies and measures in clean energy research and innovation will support the achievement of the energy and climate targets, as outlined in the National Energy and Climate Plans.</span></p><p><span>The Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETP) aims to empower the energy transition and contribute from a R&amp;I perspective to the EU\u2019s goal of becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. To achieve this ambitious goal, Europe needs to embark into a transformative process of both the energy system and its supporting technologies, as well as of the society. Key enabling and disruptive technologies, as well system innovation are essential for this transition. With robust investment in innovation and technology development, the energy transition turns into an opportunity for sustainable growth and competitiveness, creating high-quality jobs and leaving nobody behind.</span></p><p><span>The Clean Energy Transition partnership is expected to contribute to the overarching goal of transitioning to a clean energy system by pooling national and regional resources/funding programmes thus overcoming a fragmented approach.
