CCAM solutions will shift design and development from a driver-centred to mobility-user oriented approach, providing viable alternatives for private vehicle ownership while increasing inclusiveness of mobility.

The Vision of the Partnership is: \u201cEuropean leadership in safe and sustainable road transport through automation\u201d. It aims to harmonise European R&amp;I efforts to accelerate the implementation of innovative CCAM technologies and services. It aims to exploit the full systemic benefits of new mobility solutions enabled by CCAM. The European Partnership on CCAM plans to closely cooperate with other European Partnerships, in particular with \u201cTowards zero emission road transport\u201d (2ZERO), \u201cDriving Urban Transitions\u201d (DUT), \u201cKey digital technologies\u201d (KDT), \u201cSmart networks and services\u201d (SNS) and \u201cAI, data and robotics\u201d (AI).

In particular, the areas of infrastructure, logistics and network/traffic management play a major role in making mobility and transport climate neutral, also through the digitalisation of the sectors. At the same time, being vulnerable to climate change and other disruptions, resilience in these three areas need to be increased. New and advanced infrastructures across all transport modes are required to enable the introduction of new vehicles, operations and mobility services. Furthermore, efficient and smart multimodal logistics are key for seamless and sustainable long-haul, regional and urban freight transport movements. Finally, dynamic multimodal network and traffic management systems are the \u201cglue\u201d of the entire transport network, for optimised door-to-door mobility of both passengers and freight.</p><p>To test solutions related to multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and good, applicants may seek possibilities of involving the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy and mobility applications of the JRC Living Lab for Future Urban Ecosystems[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc\">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc</a>]].</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting Multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and goods under this Destination are:</p><ul><li>Upgraded and resilient physical and digital infrastructure for clean, accessible, affordable, connected and automated multimodal mobility.</li><li>Sustainable and smart long-haul, regional and urban freight transport and logistics, through increased efficiency, improved interconnectivity and smart enforcement.</li><li>Reduced external costs (e.g. congestion, traffic jams, emissions, air and noise pollution, road collisions) of urban, peri-urban (regional) and long distance freight transport as well as optimised system-wide network efficiency and resilience.</li><li>Enhanced local and/or regional capacity for governance and innovation in urban mobility and logistics.</li></ul><p><i><strong><u>Safety and resilience - per mode and across all transport modes</u></strong></i></p><p>Safety and resilience are of primary concern for any transport system. The EU set ambitious targets in its 2011 Transport White Paper, the third Mobility Package and, more recently, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[[COM(2020) 789 final.]]. COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the importance of resilience to external disruptions, particularly for transport. Research and innovation will underpin the three pillars affecting safety and resilience: technologies; regulations (alongside acceptable level of risks); and human factors (individual and organisational aspects, including interaction with automation). The approach is risk-based and systemic, including transport means/vehicles, infrastructure, the physical environment (e.g. weather) and the various actors (e.g. manufacturers, regulators, operators, users) as well as all their interfaces, including certification and standardisation bodies.</p><p>Synergies should be exploited across research at national, EU and international level together with national authorities, EU agencies and international organisations to improve rulemaking, safety promotion and oversight.</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting transport safety and resilience under this Destination are:</p><p><i>Safety in Urban Areas/ Road Transport Safety</i></p><ul><li>50% reduction in serious injuries and fatalities in road crashes by 2030.</li><li>Improved reliability and performance of systems that aim to anticipate and minimize safety risks, avoiding risks and collisions, and reducing the consequences of unavoidable crashes.</li><li>Drastic reduction of road fatalities and serious crash injuries in low and medium income countries in Africa.</li><li>Better design principles of future road transport systems enabling also better traffic flow in big cities.</li></ul><p><i>Waterborne Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Ensure healthy passenger shipping by preventing and mitigating the spread of contagious diseases and infections.</li></ul><p><i>Aviation Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Decrease number of accidents and incidents due to organisational/human/automation factors and external hazards in all phases of flight, also beyond CAT category (80% goal in FlightPath2050), while enabling all weather operations.</li><li>Saving lives following a crash (post-crash survivability).</li><li>Anticipate emergence of new threats that could generate potential accidents and incidents (short, medium, and long term).</li><li>Ensure safety through aviation transformation (from green/digital technologies uptake up to independent certification).</li><li>Maintain safety and resilience despite the scale, pace and diversity of new entrants.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Safe, Resilient Transport and Smart Mobility services for passengers and goods", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["cooperative intelligent transport systems", "road authorities", "C-ITS", "intelligent transport systems", "communication", "ITS", "ODD", "PDI", "cooperation", "road operators", "physical and digital infrastructure", "interoperability", "connectivity", "Operational Design Domains"], "keywords": ["Transport engineering, intelligent transport syste", "Co-programmed European Partnerships", "International Cooperation", "Transport engineering"], "flags": ["PART-COPROGR", "EC-WORLD"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "24 June 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["19 October 2021"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3352273": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-01 -

Road authorities and operators can provide essential PDI information to vehicles, road users and other modes of transport. As a complement, connectivity and cooperation are important capabilities of the full range of V2X actors (vehicles, infrastructures, vulnerable road users etc.). This is a necessary condition to proceed towards CCAM services in a developing CCAM ecosystem (involving benefits for e.g. road and mobility users, manufacturers across sectors, traffic management actors). </span></p><p><span>Actions are expected to address the activities either under area A) Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) supporting CCAM or under area B) Connectivity and cooperation as enablers for CCAM and advanced traffic management while taking into account the complementing nature of both areas.</span></p><p><em><span>Area A: Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) supporting CCAM</span></em></p><p><span>The Physical and Digital Infrastructure (PDI) is pivotal to improve CCAM services. The physical elements of infrastructure include markings, road signs, layout, etc., while the digital components encompass digitised spatial network including relevant traffic rules and regulations, input from road-side sensors, HD maps integrating static and dynamic data, etc. PDI support will particularly help in more challenging geographical or weather conditions, and can mitigate failure situations or gaps in the Operational Design Domain (ODD).</span></p><p><span>Research results so far have shown that the definition of ODD and infrastructure support level requirements serve as common basis of physical and digital infrastructure attributes in different Operational Environments (e.g. highly complex urban, interurban and motorway, peri-urban, dense traffic). Proposals are expected to develop a service architecture built upon this basis, which improves the functionality of highly automated vehicles by supporting their \u201csense, plan and act\u201d ability. This service architecture will provide PDI support, which offers a finer gradation of dynamic traffic management regulations and can further increase the functional safety and the traffic efficiency \u2013 or more general, the performance \u2013 of CCAM services. Secure and trustworthy interaction between vehicles, infrastructure, and third-party services needs to be ensured, as well as addressing the aspect of maintenance/evolution for both types of infrastructure.</span></p><p><span>Proposed actions should build upon recent work of the CCAM Platform on classifying PDI elements</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup><span> and develop a comprehensive classification scheme that also allows for describing the PDI support (and the regular update) on road network sections (what, where, when).</span></p><p><span>R&amp;I actions should advance the technological readiness of PDI support (e.g. Proof-of-Concept) to level 6/7 on the way towards (pre-) deployment as an important contribution to large-scale demonstration actions.</span></p><p><span>Recurring technology and process innovation however bears the risk that investment, especially in sectors with long cycles, are devalued well before their (end of) lifetime. It is crucial to balance premature action versus deferral of decision making and proposed actions should therefore analyse the risks, benefits and required investments in PDI support and provide guidance towards minimum adaptations of PDI that provide a substantial and sustainable added value to CCAM.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should take into account that EU-wide/global harmonisation is key in this R&amp;I action, enabling broad uptake of services in the common single market and paving the way towards coordinated deployment of necessary infrastructure support for CCAM. Potential needs for standardisation or input for future regulatory action should be developed.</span></p><p><em><span>Area B: Connectivity and cooperation as enablers for CCAM and advanced traffic management</span></em></p><p><span>CCAM systems and services as well as advanced traffic management use connectivity and cooperation for e.g. exchanging information on status and intentions, realising collective perception, planning cooperative manoeuvres on roads, negotiating slots (time, space) for executing manoeuvres. The first generation of C-ITS services (Day 1 services), limited to provide status information, represents a prominent example of grown technological readiness that have recently made their way into deployment in vehicles and the road infrastructure. The next wave of services, also taking advantage of emerging technologies, should enable connected cooperative automated mobility. Proposals have to build upon or further progress already deployed services, first concepts and message designs for next generation C-ITS services, as developed in C-ROADS, as well as insight from ongoing 5G Corridors for Connected and Automated Mobility. Proposed actions should address and sufficiently test all the following aspects in real traffic conditions:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Data provision through communication channels from external sources (e.g. road status, traffic and weather conditions from vehicle external sources) increasing the functionality of CCAM services and traffic management as well as road safety, traffic efficiency and environmental protection.</span></li><li><span>Ensuring interoperability and continuity of services, backwards compatibility of proposed solutions, supporting a mixed use or range of technologies (hybrid communication) while ensuring privacy and security for all, in all communication channels. </span></li> </ul><p><span>Because of the enabling nature of connectivity and cooperation as well as cross-sector links, proposed research has to contribute to an integrated collaborative perspective of CCAM. Proposals should include in research and testing all relevant actors across sectors to co-design CCAM services.
