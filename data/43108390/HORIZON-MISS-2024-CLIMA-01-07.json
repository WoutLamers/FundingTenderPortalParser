Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf</a>]].</p><p>The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the <strong>Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, </strong>to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice \u2013 the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>", "missionDescription": "Mission: Adaptation to climate change (2023/24)", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["local communities", "Mission on adaptation to climate change", "rural areas", "demonstration"], "keywords": ["Climate change adaptation", "Sustainable development and climate action", "Nature-based solutions", "Environment, Pollution & Climate"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094502, "abbreviation": "Open", "description": "Open"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "24 April 2024", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["18 September 2024"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3523386": [{"action": "HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-04 -

As a very large number of localities are indeed small or medium in size, with large and rural territories, their lack of preparedness translates in a crucial weakness of the overall continent preparedness and response to the changing climate. The shortage of skilled labour and in particular of experts with climate assessment and environmental skills prevent a majority of municipalities from implementing local investments<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>This capacity limitation, coupled with the typical large territorial responsibility of the involved authorities and the very diverse risks they are exposed, makes in many cases difficult to leverage efficiencies of scale as it is the case in more densely populated areas. This has unluckily translated in many cases into more deadly impacts of extreme weathers events in relation to the population exposed.</p><p>Proposals should identify approaches and innovative solutions leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change which are particularly suitable for implementation by small and medium local authorities and the rural context. These solutions could include technological, social and business-related aspects or a combination of those. Nature-based solutions should be explored as priority and be at the very heart of the development whenever possible. Moreover, particular attention should be given to the potential of digital solutions in a rural or small/medium size population entity context, to also support their twin digital transition. Opportunities of circular economy to increase resilience and reduce dependencies should be seized<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>.</p><p>The proposed solutions should specifically address the most urgent climate risks identified at the local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account local specificities, such as, socio-economic, identity characteristics and governance. Alongside the solutions, the proposal should support small and medium local authorities to close skills gaps and strengthen in-house capabilities for climate adaptation. To best focus the approaches and solutions to the local challenges, the proposal is expected to clearly identify the type of actors it addresses, being those either rural areas or small sized urban areas.</p><p>The participation of small and medium-sized local authorities in the consortium is strongly encouraged and would be evaluated positively as this can support the development in-house capacities and skills. However, as the capacity and availability for engagement of small / medium size local communities and in the rural area might be too limited to directly participate in the consortium, the proposal should at a minimum include specific considerations on how to facilitate their engagement and how their needs are reflected. This could take, for example, the form of a board or of a consultation body where they are directly engaged singularly or in association and/or grouping between themselves, should this be the preferred approach and form for the local authorities to delegate specific local competences, or could be achieved potentially leveraging the support already put in place by the Mission Implementation Platform<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three locations, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three \u201creplicating\u201d regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the \u201creplicating\u201d regions. Replicating regions/local authorities/communities are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare already the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, or the Just Transition Fund.</p><p>Additionally, proposals should connect to other relevant projects funded by Horizon<s>-</s> Europe, in particular on just climate resilience and transformative approach funded by the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-05: Improve design for transformative approaches and build local capacity for implementation of available solutions focused on climate adaptation. Synergies and cooperation could also be beneficial with the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-1-two-stage: Innovating for climate-neutral rural communities by 2050.</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with the Mission Implementation and the Climate-ADAPT<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> platforms.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will get direct access and are expected to contribute into the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.</p><p>In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Topic Conditions</SPAN>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 to 7 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B. </p></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>defined as towns with between 5000 and 50000 inhabitants \u2013 ESPON TOWN project - <a href=\"https://www.espon.eu/programme/projects/espon-2013/applied-research/town-%E2%80%93-small-and-medium-sized-towns\">TOWN \u2013 Small and Medium-Sized Towns | ESPON</a>ect -</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>Skills shortage is delaying the green transition, EIB Municipality Survey shows</p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>See as reference the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative <a href=\"https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/\">https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu</a></p><p id=fn4><a  target=_self href=#r4>[4]</a>Currently managed by MIP4Adapt under the contract CINEA/2022/OP/0013/SI2.884597 funded by the European Union. <a href=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/the-mission/about-mip4adapt\">About MIP4Adapt (europa.eu)</a></p><p id=fn5><a  target=_self href=#r5>[5]</a>The European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT is a partnership between the DG Climate Action and the European Environment Agency.https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/</p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
