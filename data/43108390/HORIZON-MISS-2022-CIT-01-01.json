Achieving such a state would require balancing of residual emissions with emission (carbon dioxide) removal as well as accounting for regional or local biogeophysical effects of human activities that, for example, affect surface albedo or local climate.\u201d For the purpose of the Cities Mission, climate neutrality for a city should be assessed based on: (1) scope 1 GHG emissions, i.e. emissions within the geographic boundary from buildings, industry, transport, waste treatment, agriculture and forestry and from other activities, and (2) scope 2 GHG emissions, i.e. indirect emissions due to consumption of grid-supplied electricity within the geographic boundary and indirect emissions due to consumption of grid-supplied heat or cold within the geographic boundary.]] and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution. In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the European Green Deal[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</a>]] to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the UN Agenda 2030[[<a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda</a>]], the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en</a>]], the Fit for 55 strategy[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541</a>]], the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en</a>]], the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en</a>]] and the New European Bauhaus initiative [[<a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en</a>]].

Topics under the call \u201cResearch and Innovation actions to support the implementation of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission\u201d will provide support to innovative approaches to integrated urban planning and design, to large-scale demonstrations of Positive Clean Energy Districts, to activities that strengthen the innovation and inclusiveness potential of public transport and urban mobility, and to the setup of a platform to coordinate the international dimension of the Mission. Overall, the actions funded under the Work Programme will also foster the engagement of citizens and urban stakeholders as well as the mainstreaming of social innovation and of user-friendly and secure digital services.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&amp;I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility[[Including for persons with disabilities and older persons and ensuring access to essential services for all, in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights]] to leave no one behind. Due attention should be paid to solutions addressing housing affordability, mobility poverty and other distributional impacts of the transition, notably on households in vulnerable situations.</p><p>Proposals should emphasise systemic approaches by integrating, for instance, energy and mobility systems, carbon-free energy vectors and storage at district level, sustainable and carbon-free/low-emission built environment, diffusion of electrical, alternative fuels based, carbon neutral and efficient mobility and of vehicle-to-grid technology.

Such a policy will also have economic benefits. Based on conservative estimates, even current levels of cycling in the EU produce benefits valued at around 150 billion euros per year<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>.</p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, larger cities in Europe announced infrastructure changes to promote cycling and walking. For instance, they temporarily widened or created new cycle lanes to allow safe overtaking with physical distancing limits in mind while also implementing more 30km/h limits or 20km/h zones. The scope of this action is to support local authorities in accelerating mobility changes and address a significant concern, namely that people returning to work after the lockdown will seek out alternatives so that allocating public space, bicycles, pedestrians and public transport and reducing the space available for cars will encourage people to cycle, walk or use public transport rather than take the car.</p><p>Taking into account where possible the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, projects should collect data on differences between patterns, behaviours and habits in relation to the mobility of various categories of vulnerable road users. Such data should where possible, be integrated with cross-domain data, to ensure interdependencies and co-benefits are identified. Projects should identify specific mobility needs and public space re-design needs, taking into account actual and perceived safety and security of women, children and accessibility for people with disabilities e.g. blind people in shared spaces, people in prams, wheelchairs and other supporting vehicles. Measures should be taken to implement necessary changes within the timeline of the project.</p><p>In addition, projects should also provide clear guidance to cities and Member States and Associated Countries on how to systematically incorporate the vulnerable road users dimension into infrastructure planning, including aspects of safety and security, accessibility, digital and smart tools for enforcing speed limits and vehicle access, design and operation or services and public spaces, including mobility hubs, public transport and shared mobility.</p><p>The projects associated to this call topic should envisage cooperation with the SUMP coordination platform, ELTIS<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> and produce thematic a comprehensive topic guides stemming from the projects and accompanying the SUMP guidelines.</p><p>Projects should also take stock of lessons learnt during the period of imposition and lifting of Covid-related restrictions and propose suitable solutions for the future when it comes to resilience, safety and accessibility of public infrastructure.</p><p>A thorough evaluation, with a clear baseline in each city, should provide qualitative and quantitative information on the results of the local solutions implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed measures in achieving local policy objectives on safety, security and accessibility as well as on climate and pollution should be evaluated and the possible barriers to their broad take up and deployment identified, together with recommendations on how to overcome them. This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the CIVITAS Initiative.</p><p>Proposals must plan for an active collaboration amongst the projects selected under this topic - for dissemination, evaluation and coordination - facilitated by and within the CIVITAS initiative through the signature of collaboration agreement. Proposals should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work-plan of the proposal. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined during the grant agreement phase. Collaboration with the Mission Platform (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and should take place through the CIVITAS initiative. The latter should establish, through a Memorandum of Understanding, clear links with the Mission portfolio for synergies and complementarities.</p><p>Proposals may include preparatory, take up and replication actions, research activities, as well as tools to support local planning and policy making.
