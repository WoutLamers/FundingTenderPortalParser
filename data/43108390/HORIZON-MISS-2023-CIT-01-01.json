In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a> to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">UN Agenda 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">EU Zero Pollution Action Plan</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">Fit for 55 strategy</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en\">EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en\">the EU Industrial Strategy</a><u>, the </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/bioeconomy/bioeconomy-strategy_en\">EU Bioeconomy Strategy</a> and the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">New European Bauhaus initiative</a>. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.</p><p>Topics under the 2023 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&amp;I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);</li><li>engage cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;</li><li>develop and test a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis.</li> </ul><p>The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en</a>]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.</p><p>Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&amp;I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.</p><p>Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.</p><p>The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.</p><p>In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.</p><p>Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically to the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions.</li><li>Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity.</li><li>Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects.</li><li>Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral.</li><li>Increased capacity among European cities, with particular attention to those selected under the Cities Mission, to design and roll out their Climate City Contracts, including related investment plans and to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030.</li> </ul>", "missionDescription": "Mission: Climate neutral and smart cities (2023/24)", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["climate-neutral cities", "smart mobility solutions", "mobility solutions", "electrification, automation and connectivity", "active mobility", "modular and interoperable last mile choices", "zero-emission solutions and services", "freight transport", "co-designed innovative passenger mobility", "micromobility", "mobility infrastructure", "digital twins", "automated and connected functions"], "keywords": ["Low emission technology in transport", "Decarbonisation", "Transport services", "Artificial Intelligence", "Automation", "Transport engineering, intelligent transport syste", "Mobility plans", "Transport management", "Mobility and transportation", "Urban transport", "Climate change mitigation", "Digital Agenda", "Greenhouse gases", "Co-programmed European Partnerships"], "flags": ["AI", "DigitalAgenda", "PART-COPROGR"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "10 January 2023", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["27 April 2023"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3480227": [{"action": "HORIZON-MISS-2023-CIT-01-02 -

This requires a mutual understanding and alignment of the opportunities of technical solutions from the CCAM and 2Zero partnerships and of needs identified by users and cities striving for the Mission target of climate neutrality.</p><p>Proposals should include co-designed innovative passenger mobility and freight transport concepts which are agreed between technology providers and cities, in cooperation with end users, citizens and other stakeholders (for example visitors) to optimise the performance, ease of use and to maximise uptake. They should then be tested and demonstrated in real environments and use cases before being replicated. They should complement current public transport and freight transport services as well as active mobility and micromobility, also with modular and interoperable last mile choices, while being scalable for the roll out, adaptability and co-implementation for different types of cities. At the same time, they should help to identify new challenges, e.g. regarding flexibility, privacy and resilience, in order to set requirements for the further improvement of technologies.</p><p>Proposals are expected to develop, test and demonstrate innovative solutions for mobility of people and freight exploiting the combined potential of electrification, automation and connectivity. Proposals must consider and explore the opportunities for technology transfer and synergy potentials with the respective other domain to fully cover passenger and goods mobility, although a primary focus on either people or goods mobility is possible. Solutions should be based on existing technologies and should satisfy cities\u2019 and users\u2019 needs, targeting implementation of pilot cases at city level to ensure feasibility, buy-in, acceptance and thus a seamless integration of mobility solutions and infrastructure in a citywide transport system.</p><p>All the following aspects should be addressed by the proposals:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Establish a co-design process between local public authorities, city planners, end users (for example inhabitants, visitors, commuters) and automated and zero-emission mobility systems providers to ensure a user-centric and seamless integration of solutions in existing ecosystems.</li><li>Build upon the results of recent collaborative research on, for example, power grid integration, charging infrastructure, vehicle connectivity, automation or smart fleet, road traffic and energy management, safety of vulnerable road users, and also build upon relevant experience of cities and partnerships.</li><li>Demonstrate integrated and shared, automated and zero-emission solutions and services for people mobility and freight transport. Where needed and duly justified, design of vehicles and functions and the development of specific infrastructures for energy and joint and harmonized data management<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup> to extend and optimise their use can be included.</li><li>Develop open while resilient systems and replicable solutions that can be scaled-up within a city environment and flexibly adapted to current and evolving needs and use cases in the context of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP). Mobility services to and from sub-urban areas should be included in proposed solutions, so as to widen the pool of possible users of these solutions, services and systems.</li><li>Co-design implementation plans for local and regional transport authorities to roll-out innovative smart mobility solutions and related infrastructure (in particular for charging and connectivity) and to lower energy demand.</li><li>Evaluate cost and benefits of the systems and services tested along with real-world challenges and opportunities, based on user and city needs, and provide feedback on viability and limitations as well as new requirements to the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships.</li><li>Support the development of skills on the planning and implementation of smart, shared and zero-emission urban mobility systems within the local authorities and co-creation with private stakeholders along SUMP and SULP (Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning) guidelines, e.g. the practitioner briefing on Road Vehicle Automation of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans.</li><li>Disseminate results via the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships and the Mission Platform and via relevant events, such as CIVITAS, Transport Research Arena (TRA) conference and other European events.</li> </ul><p>Proposals should fully exploit technologies developed/under development in the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships when designing, testing and demonstrating solutions and services, such as, e.g., automated and connected functions or digital twins optimising the charging, parking, safe (remote) control, operational design domain of vehicles or the fleet, traffic management and last-mile operations.</p><p>To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects\u2019 ambition, progress and effect compared to the state of the art in the European Union and internationally, proposals are expected to provide measurable or predictable indicators of contributions of the tested solutions to the applicable outcomes and impacts expected from the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships as well as the Cities Mission. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets and appropriate review processes for each participating city and include a detailed analysis of present and future potential user groups. The \u2018CIVITAS Process and Impact Evaluation Framework\u2019 and \u2018Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators\u201d, where appropriate in combination with other sector-specific impact evaluation methodologies, should be used to evaluate the impact of the solutions.</p><p>Selected projects may consider including activities to investigate and foster societal readiness, for example by measuring the acceptability of new mobility solutions as well as behavioural change. This could include inter alia methods of co-assessment as well as actions to increase public awareness in order to anticipate and mitigate potential negative rebound effects.</p><p>This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the Cities Mission Platform and 2Zero/CCAM partnerships.</p><p>Each proposal should envisage pilot demonstrations in at least two cities (lead cities) situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country. Proposals should provide the necessary evidence of the cities\u2019 commitment to test and implement the co-designed solutions. To foster replicability and up-taking of the outcomes, each proposal should also engage at least four replication/follower cities.</p><p>The consortia awarded under this topic must establish a collaboration agreement, to identify clear links among themselves and ensure complementarity, coordination and exchange on relevant linked activities. The consortia awarded should also foresee active collaboration with relevant and related projects funded under this call in order to address synergies and complementarities between the projects of the Cities Mission portfolio. In particular collaboration with the Mission Platform is essential. The collaboration between consortia awarded as well as with the Mission Platform must be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects' starting date.</p><p>In addition, given the important role of territories in which the participating cities are located, lead cities are encouraged to seek cooperation with and support from their territories, where relevant (metropolis, functional urban area, grouping of interacting municipalities with the cities, region, etc.). Support could take the form of, for example, an integration or link in an existing or future programme of the territory, financial support, or the involvement of representatives of these territories as partners in the project.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.\u202fSocial innovation should also be considered to support the actions under this topic in order to match innovative ideas with social needs.\u202fInclusiveness of vulnerable populations (older people, children) as well as gender perspectives in mobility should be considered.</p><p>If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries are expected to clearly describe if and how the use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS are incorporated in the proposed solutions. In addition, if the activities proposed involve the use and/or development of AI-based systems and/or techniques, the technical and social robustness of the proposed systems has to be described in the proposal.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Topic Conditions</SPAN>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B.</p></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>The budget of this topic consists of EUR 20 million coming from contributions to Missions from various Horizon Europe Clusters and an additional EUR 30 million from Cluster 5, to be considered outside the missions\u2019 budget, representing the contribution of the partnerships involved in this topic.</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a><sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/soil-strategy_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/soil-strategy_en</a></p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>Compliant with FAIR data principles (https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/turning_fair_into_reality_0.pdf.)</p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
