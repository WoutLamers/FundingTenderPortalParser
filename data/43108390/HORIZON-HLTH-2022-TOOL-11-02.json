Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019 </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health technologies, new tools and digital solutions are applied effectively thanks to their inclusive, secure and ethical development, delivery, integration and deployment in health policies and health and care systems\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018A competitive and secure data-economy\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people\u2019</em>, and <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019</em>. </span></p><p><span>Technology is a key driver for innovation in the health care sector. It can provide better and more cost-efficient solutions with high societal impact, tailored to the specific health care needs of the individual. However, novel tools, therapies, technologies and digital approaches face specific barriers and hurdles in piloting, implementing and scaling-up before reaching the patient, encountering additional challenges such as public acceptance and trust. Emerging and disruptive technologies offer big opportunities for transforming health care, thereby promoting the health and well-being of citizens. Unlocking this potential and harnessing the opportunities depends on the capacity to collect, integrate and interpret large amounts of data, as well as ensure compatibility with appropriate regulatory frameworks and infrastructures that will both safeguard the rights of the individual and of society and stimulate innovation to develop impactful solutions. In addition to existing European Research Infrastructures, the European Health Data Space will promote health-data exchange and facilitate cross-border research activities. This destination aims to promote the development of tools, technologies and digital solutions for treatments, medicines, medical devices and improved health outcomes, taking into consideration safety, effectiveness, appropriateness, accessibility, comparative value-added and fiscal sustainability as well as issues of ethical, legal and regulatory nature. </span></p><p><span>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe) or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe).

The principal aim of this topic is to address the data needs of health regulatory bodies and HTA bodies across the EU, as outlined in the recently published \u201cHMA-EMA Joint Big Data Taskforce Phase II report: \u2018Evolving Data-Driven Regulation\u2019\u201d</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup><span> and its associated DARWIN (Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network) project</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup><span>.</span></p><p><span>To harness the potential of RWD and synthetic data from digital twins and advanced analytical models, and make them actionable for health regulatory decision-making and for health technology assessment, targeted research is needed on the evidentiary value of these data for a number of relevant use cases. In addition, methods need to be developed to increase the usability of such data by different stakeholder groups. Doing so will contribute to the European Health Data Space and maximise the positive impact of DARWIN in driving up the quality of evidence and decisions on the development and use of medicines and digital health innovations. </span></p><p><span>Access to and analysis of RWD and synthetic data can inform regulatory decision-making throughout the product lifecycle, namely: 1) support product development (e.g. scientific advice, PRIME</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup><span>),); 2) support authorisation of new medicines and digital health innovations; and 3) monitor the performance of medicines and digital health innovations on the market (effectiveness and safety). Eventually, this will put in place methods and processes that will enable continuous learning from pre-authorisation procedures and authorisation applications on the use of RWD and/or synthetic data.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should address all of the following areas: </span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Develop a set of evidentiary standards to be pre-specified and used in the analysis of real-word evidence and/or synthetic data applied to different types of regulatory advice and/or health technology assessment and decisions on the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of medicines and digital health innovations (e.g. in complement to clinical trial data in an authorisation application, or for extension of indications, post marketing surveillance, amendment of product information or regulatory actions on the marketing authorisation due to safety concerns). This includes validating the use of advanced analytical methods for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment. </span></li><li><span>Address aspects that would enable moving towards a standard data quality framework reproducible across different types of RWD and/or synthetic data sources for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment, with a characterisation of the data collection, management and reporting and an empirical data quality validation. In this regard, it will be important that successful proposals liaise with and closely monitor the work carried out in the context of the European Health Data Space.</span></li><li><span>Enhance the performance and efficiency of large randomised clinical trials and new models of clinical trials by developing standardised processes and methods to access RWD and/or synthetic data (e.g., facilitating the detection of various types of health outcomes during the treatment period of a double-blinded trial by linkage to appropriate electronic health care record databases, etc.), for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment. </span></li><li><span>Define methodological standards for the regulatory acceptability of RWD, and/or synthetic data in the context of clinical trials augmented with RWD, and/or synthetic data, for regulatory decision making and/or health technology assessment. </span></li><li><span>Test the ability of machine learning methods to help identify relevant RWD, and/or synthetic data to match with and to interpret clinical trials, for regulatory decision\u2011making and/or health technology assessment.</span></li><li><span>Assess and validate how machine learning methods can be systematically harnessed to screen a large amount of data, including unstructured data, in many electronic databases to identify factors affecting efficacy and safety of treatments and/or digital health innovations, for regulatory decision-making and/or health technology assessment. The cross-border interoperability dimension should be taken into account. </span></li> </ul><p><span>Proposals should involve researchers who are specialised in the use of real-world data and/or synthetic data to evaluate medicinal products and/or health care digital innovation products and services. Proposals should involve national competent authorities (national health care product regulatory bodies and/or medical device notified bodies) and could involve citizens and patients\u2019 representatives where relevant. Proposals should include capacity-building efforts to address inequalities of health regulatory processes across Europe. This should comprise education and training activities and sharing of best practices.</span></p><p><span>In addition to national competent authorities, proposals could consider the involvement of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for an added value in order to provide an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects and/or to translate the research results into validated test methods and strategies that would be fit for regulatory purpose.</span></p><p>Proposals could also consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) to provide added-value regarding health registry data, interoperability, harmonisation and quality and linking with other data.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p>Digital Agenda<br>Social sciences and humanities<br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=EoscAndFairData;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EOSC and FAIR data</a><br>Artificial Intelligence<br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><span>Real world data is an umbrella term for data regarding the effects of health interventions that are not collected in the context of highly-controlled RCTs.
