They represent 99.8% of all enterprises in the European Union (EU) non-financial business sector and two thirds of employment. However, SMEs in Europe face obstacles to growth, expansion and scaling up, including lack of skills, administrative burden, and access to finance. Many lack capacity for innovation and struggle to enter international markets.</p><p>Greater cooperation with partners in Europe and beyond can help to address many of these issues. However, opportunities for bottom-up, international collaborations are limited. European SMEs can struggle to find support for their internationalisation efforts. At national level, support is often limited to collaboration among partners within the same Member State. Levels of investment to support internationalisation in European innovative SMEs vary and there is suboptimal co-ordination of national schemes. Overall, these issues weaken the resilience of the European innovation ecosystem.</p><p>The objective of this call is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership of Innovative SMEs identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-EIE-2021-INNOVSMES-01-01: European Partnership on Innovative SMEs, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.</p><p>The proposal for the topic under this destination should cover a specific niche that other EU, national and regional interventions do not address for the benefit of innovative SMEs in Europe: cooperation among European and/or international partners, with at least one innovative SME as the project leader. The proposed additional activities would help innovative SMEs to increase their research and innovation (R&amp;I) capacity and productivity and to become embedded in global value chains and new markets. It would achieve this by supporting innovative SMEs in developing products, processes and services through funding market-led, cross-border, R&amp;I collaborative projects and providing accompanying measures. It would enable global collaboration and the commercialisation of new knowledge. It would thereby strengthen the overall resilience of the European innovation ecosystem.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe objectives[[<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/695/oj\">Horizon Europe Regulation</a>, Article.3.2.(b), (c).]] it aims to generate knowledge, support the access to and uptake of innovative solutions by SMEs (including to address global challenges), facilitate technological development, demonstration, knowledge and technology transfer, and strengthen deployment and exploitation of innovative solutions.</p><p>In line with Horizon Europe Strategic Planning, the partnership aims to contribute to global and European policies. In particular the strategic priorities of the European Commission with a special focus on the \u2018European Green Deal\u2019 and \u2018An economy that works for people\u2019 including the SME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe, as well actions towards tackling the COVID-19 crisis and the post-COVID era.</p><p>In line with the Global Approach to Research and Innovation[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/strategy_on_research_and_innovation/documents/ec_rtd_com2021-252.pdf\">COM(2021) 252 final.</a>]]<sup> </sup>the partnership aims to facilitate the internationalisation of European SMEs by establishing win-win international innovation partnerships, such as networks of incubators and accelerators with countries that offer reciprocal openness to entrepreneurship and investment, promoting mobility of innovators in both directions. The envisaged activities will build on tools developed and experience gained and by creating synergies with other supporting mechanisms.</p><p><strong><u>Expected impact</u></strong></p><p>The proposal for the topic under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:</p><p>To help European innovative SMEs to grow and successfully access European and international markets and to embed in global value chains by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Contributing to the strategic priorities of the European Commission with a special focus on the \u2018European Green Deal\u2019 and \u2018An economy that works for people\u2019 including the SME Strategy for a sustainable and digital Europe, as well actions towards tackling the COVID-19 crisis and the post-COVID era.</li><li>Strengthening the innovation performance, output, potential and resilience of the European innovation ecosystem;</li><li>Addressing the productivity and internationalisation gap between innovative SMEs and large companies and aiming to improve SMEs\u2019 global scale-up potential leading to increased employment and turnover;</li><li>Leveraging investment for innovative SMEs.</li> </ul>", "destinationDescription": "INNOVSMES -

Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in 2021-2022 based on this planning and further to the European Partnership on Innovative SMEs topic. It is also deemed relevant that the same consortium was responsible for carrying out the Horizon 2020 predecessor programme EUROSTARS 2. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.</p><p>The proposal should cover all the additional activities which will be implemented using the budget and in the framework of the amendment to the existing grant agreement that will result from this proposal, and which are not covered in the existing grant agreement. The proposal should address time, resources and activities building on the two main types of activities from the previous period. These are largely additional calls for proposals covering the 2023- 2024 period (Eurostars and INNOWWIDE projects) resulting in international collaborative research and innovation projects. While these projects should further contribute to the results which were achieved in the previous period, the scope should in addition include the lessons learnt from the initial three Eurostars calls of this partnership in the first period of implementation, in order to potentially improve the activities during the forthcoming period. Furthermore, as second additional activity, it would be beneficial to analyse the results and lessons learnt from the very first Eureka-INNOWWIDE call with a new pilot phase focusing on Africa. These additional activities should contribute to the further development of the \u201cEureka-INNOWIDE\u201d scheme including its further possible evolution. Coordination and support activities, the creation of synergies between and synchronisation of national programmes, and a better cooperation and knowledge exchange between national intermediaries should be continued through new or repeated activities and additional events during the forthcoming period.</p><p>Collaborative research and innovation activities and a strong focus on support to the internationalisation of European innovative SMEs should drive the additional activities and calls for proposals during the period 2023 to 2024 in line with the overall call schedule until the end of the partnership. There is a clear added value and \u2018selling point\u2019 for the continuation and additional calls under this initiative to further address gaps towards a better alignment and increased focus on internationalisation. This reflects and recalls the definition of European Partnerships in the Horizon Europe regulation<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> as initiatives where the union and its partners \u2018commit to jointly support the development and implementation of a programme of research and innovation activities, including those related to market, regulatory or policy uptake.\u2019</p><p>The below list of specific activities, going beyond research and innovation activities, can therefore be implemented under the period of 2023-2024 (continuation of the partnership) and are anticipated as expected outputs to:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support transnational near-market collaborative research and innovation addressing technological and societal challenges;</li><li>Enhance SME readiness (absorptive capacities in all participating countries),</li><li>Attract wide range of beneficiaries by country and SME type and age;</li><li>Create synergies among national programmes by streamlining their execution;</li><li>Enhance cooperation and knowledge exchange at level of national intermediaries.</li><li>Lessons learnt concerning proposals and project implementations for future improvements.</li> </ul><p>The proposed continuation of the initiative will help innovative SMEs to further increase their research and innovation capacities and productivity, shorten the time to market of their innovations and to become embedded in global value chains and new and/or expanded markets. It will achieve this through additional support to innovative SMEs in developing products, processes and services through funding market-led, cross-border, research and innovation collaborative projects and providing accompanying measures. The initiative addresses collaboration in Europe and beyond, and the commercialisation of new knowledge. Thereby it will strengthen the overall resilience of the European innovation ecosystem.</p><p>The overall objective of the initiative, to be conducted during the full duration of Horizon Europe, is to implement a co-funded European Partnership for Innovative SMEs to stimulate economic growth and job creation by enhancing the competitiveness of innovative SMEs while contributing to deliver a positive economic, societal and environmental impact in Europe and beyond.</p><p>In order to address that objective, the initiative should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enable innovative SMEs to develop all forms of innovation, including breakthrough innovation, and strengthen market deployment of innovative solutions;</li><li>Foster the internationalisation of European innovative SMEs;</li><li>Connect national programmes to unlock the potential of all partners.</li> </ul><p>While the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under European Partnership on Innovative SMEs and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.</p><p>Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of the topic HORIZON-EIE-2021-INNOVSMES-01-01: European Partnership on Innovative SMEs and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present as an Annex the additional activities (including additional partners) to be covered by the award in terms of amendments to the grant agreement that would result from the action.</p><p>The Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.</p><p><u>Type and range of activities</u></p><p>A main activity would be to run calls for proposals, organise the evaluation process and enable collaborative cross-border research and innovation projects. Beyond providing funding to innovative SMEs for cross-border research and innovation (R&amp;I) collaboration, they should include further promotion of the programme in underrepresented Member States, including but not limited to, through dissemination events, mutual learning seminars or roadshows.</p><p>The initiative should exploit synergies with cohesion policy funds and significantly support the widening aspect. In any case, links with regional smart specialisation strategies should be a priority.</p><p>Accompanying measures such as INNOWWIDE should be included in the proposal.</p><p><u>Expected partner composition and geographical coverage</u></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>National administrations and National Funding Bodies (NFBs).</li> </ul><p>The private sector and research actors would need to be mainly drawn from the activities of the national and/or regional funding organisations. The effort, networks and judgements of these organisations are key to initiate cross-border research collaborations, to help prepare applications and to fund successful participants. The success of the initiative depends largely on these organisations.</p><p>A dedicated implementation structure may notably support them through various activities and services such as to organise calls, manage funding, monitor payments and projects and implement dissemination events, roadshows, matchmaking events, webinars etc.</p><p>The initiative should have an extended geographical coverage beyond Member States and Associated Countries, and the potential to evolve towards a global programme under Horizon Europe, including through possible involvement of additional partners during the lifetime of the programme. Third countries are welcome to participate in the Partnership in line with the standard criteria related to co-funded partnerships in Horizon Europe. The initiative should promote the ambition towards more projects involving other partners than those in geographical proximity and the sufficient utilisation of the potential of the extended Eureka network.</p><p><u>Types and levels of contributions from partners </u></p><p>Proposals should mobilise the necessary financial resources from participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joints call for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.</p><p>Member States are invited to maximise the financial support provided to innovative SMEs through increased national funding during the selection process.</p><p><u>International dimension</u></p><p>Proposals should focus on supporting international, projects led by innovative SMEs. They should enable international cooperation, enabling small businesses to learn, combine and share expertise and benefit from working beyond national borders.</p><p>In line with the ambitions of the partnership to foster international collaboration and the provisions of the model grant agreement, projects involving one legal entity established in a Member State or Associated Country as beneficiary and one legal entity established in a non-associated third country as partner may be supported in the same manner as under Eurostars 2. As per Horizon Europe rules, projects with no participants from Member States or Associated Countries are not eligible for participation in the partnership. At least two thirds (67%) of the projects supported must involve at least two beneficiaries from Member States or Associated Countries.</p><p><u>Synergies</u></p><p>Focussing on helping European innovative SMEs to grow and successfully embed in international markets and value chains by developing methodologies and technologies, the partnership is expected to collaborate closely with other relevant European Partnerships, missions and the European Innovation Council in order to ensure coherence and complementarity of activities. Proposals must describe the methodology for their collaboration and the aims the project wants to achieve with this kind of collaboration.</p><p>Proposals should include only their commitments for the period covered by the present work programme.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Topic Conditions</SPAN>:<p><p>The total indicative budget for the duration of the co-funded Partnership EUR 250 million.</p></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><sup> </sup>Definition as per Article 2(47) of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020JC0004\">Horizon Europe Regulation</a>.</p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
