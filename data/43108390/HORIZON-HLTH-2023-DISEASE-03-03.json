Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare\u2019 </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, and <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em>.</p><p>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[<sup> </sup>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated \u20ac115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[<sup> </sup>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].</p><p>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission\u2019s political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</p><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil security for society\u201d</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>\u201cFood, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment\u201d</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.</p><p>Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe\u2019s ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the \u201cEurope\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan\u201d[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</a>]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</a>]]. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.</p><p><u>Expected impacts: </u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care.

Proposals should focus on implementation science around evidence-based interventions that promote healthy behaviours, and that have the potential to profoundly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity.</p><p>Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, respiratory diseases, certain cancers, and mental health disorders, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both LMICs and HICs<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these chronic diseases further into the spotlight, as the majority of those who have experienced severe illness and/or death have had one or more underlying NCD.

Behavioural interventions might include, but are not limited to, programmes and policies that target alcohol and tobacco use, sleep, exercise promotion, healthful nutrition (e.g. in school canteens), addressing the psychosocial impacts of climate change and climate change related disasters, and reducing exposure to environmental contaminants.</p><p>Theme 2: Interventions that focus on modifying the built environment<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup></p><p>These interventions focus on modifying the built environment to improve its health-promoting potential<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>. Proposals should aim to inform urban design such that it reduces NCD risks; for example, by improving a city\u2019s walk- or bike-ability, increasing green space to reduce the health impacts of air pollution or extreme heat, reducing environmental toxins, addressing homelessness or unsafe housing, improving accessibility of healthy foods, decreasing widespread advertising for tobacco and alcohol, or reducing noise and air pollution from road traffic. For proposals that focus on modifying the built environment, applicants should demonstrate that the intervention will be able to withstand expected impacts from climate and/or improve resilience to the health impacts of climate change in city environments.</p><p>Applicants should be able to show that the city government or community-based organisation that they partner with has a dedicated budget for the construction, maintenance, and/or scale up of the proposed intervention(s), especially for large infrastructure projects. Applicants should also be able to show that the timelines of the research and construction of infrastructure projects will align such that it will be possible to answer the proposed implementation research questions over the proposed duration, and such that the research results will be available in time to inform stakeholder decisions about how the project is implemented, improved, and/or scaled up.</p><p>Proposals should include a plan on how to measure implementation research outcomes and the intervention\u2019s real-world efficacy in preventing NCDs. In case health outcomes might not be apparent over the duration of the study period, and applicants may therefore instead include plans to measure the intervention\u2019s impact on upstream health indicators, such as those related to the social determinants of health, or to measure other proxy health outcomes. Where feasible and relevant, applicants should also describe a plan for evaluating the planetary health and/or climate impacts of an intervention\u2019s implementation. Applicants are also encouraged to develop a plan for measuring outcomes or indicators relevant to non-health or environmental impacts, especially when working on projects with multi-sectoral themes (for example, themes that cut across health and transportation, social services, waste management, etc.).</p><p>Projects should consider the structural and social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s) in city environments. Of interest is also the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities<sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup>.</p><p>Projects should be gender-responsive and consider socioeconomic, racial or other factors that relate to equitable impacts of the intervention or barriers to equitable implementation. The aim should be to adapt and scale-up the implementation of these intervention(s) in accessible and equitable ways in order to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases in real-life settings. Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, physical and mental ableism, ageism, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for health promotion and disease prevention. If there is a focus on a particular population in this context, then the reason for this should be justified.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant policymakers, local authorities, as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organisations involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to propose activities to increase research capacity and capability in the field of implementation research among researchers, health professionals, and public health leaders through skill building, knowledge sharing, and networking. In this regard, they may propose plans for capacity building within their proposal, especially, but not exclusively, for early career researchers and for members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or indigenous communities.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.
