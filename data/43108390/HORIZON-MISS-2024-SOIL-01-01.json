Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup> </sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as \"the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services\".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a href=\"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/\"><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe\u2019s path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission\u2019s goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030\u2019[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission\u2019s goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup> </sup>The term \"land manager\" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations \u2013 adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019.</li><li>\u201cSoil literacy\u201d, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU\u2019s rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u> <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\"><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li> </ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u> </u><u> <u><a href=\"https://ejpsoil.eu/\">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup> </sup>An\u201c(end-) user\u201d of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic\u2019s objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a \u2018co-creation\u2019 process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create \u2018co-ownership\u2019 of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.</li><li>How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.</li><li>How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.</li><li>How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.</li><li>How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.</li><li>How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.</li> </ul><p>In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[<sup> </sup>For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network -

They support the specific objectives of the Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019 dealing with urgent soil health challenges (see in particular specific objectives 1 to 6 and 8 in the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">Mission implementation plan</a>). Activities should thereby contribute to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets, such as those related to food and nutrition security, climate, biodiversity, environment and rural areas <sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&amp;I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.</li><li>Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.</li><li>Practice-oriented knowledge and tools are more easily available to land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.</li><li>Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regard to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and \u201cgreen\u201d European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019 proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.</p><p>Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users <sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. For the purpose of the Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019, soil health living labs are defined as \u201cuser-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption\u201d.</p><p>Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level <sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. Individual sites could be, e.g., farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions.</p><p>Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as \u201cplaces for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement\u201d. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.</p><p>According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (e.g., the land use(s), the soil health challenge(s) addressed), applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites. By working together on themes of common interest, the various actors involved in a living lab will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.</p><p>More specifically, each of the funded projects should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s), addressing the same or several land use types. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission\u2019s specific objectives <sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>. Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, pedo-climatic conditions, land uses, Mission objectives addressed). Living labs exclusively focused on urban areas <sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme.</li><li>Establish, based on the projects\u2019 goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s), taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Living labs working in the area of agriculture are expected to promote sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming. Living labs working on forestry, peat and natural areas are expected to address sustainable management for healthy soils in conjunction with productive biomass and other ecosystem services.</li><li>Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">Soil Mission Implementation Plan</a> and the descriptors of the proposal for a <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en\">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a>.</li><li>Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators.</li><li>Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.</li><li>Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes.</li> </ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of actors will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g., consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, depending on their area of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying-out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties <sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup>.</p><p>Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of actors in one or more of the living labs can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Applicants are reminded they can benefit from the services of <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101090738\">NATI00NS</a>, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.</p><p>In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private (including, for example and for agricultural land, Common Agricultural Policy eco-schemes), involving, where relevant, the finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.</p><p>Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL<sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup>, the dedicated \u2018Living Lab Support Structure\u2019 established to provide tailor made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences <sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup>. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s), funded either under the Mission \u2018A Soil Deal for Europe\u2019 or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities). The details of the joint activities would be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and the life of the project.</p><p>Additionally, funded projects should collaborate with <a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101091010\">BENCHMARKS</a> and <a href=\"https://ai4soilhealth.eu/\">AI4SoilHealth</a>, which are key projects looking at sampling, monitoring, validation and further development of indicators and proxy measurements for soil health, as well as using AI technology to accelerate the collection and use of soil health information.</p><p>Cooperation with relevant networks active at local level, such as EU CAP Network operational groups for agricultural soils, is encouraged in order to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders in living labs activities or in the dissemination of solutions. The projects should also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs), the \u2018European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition: Agroecology living labs and research infrastructures\u2019 or the \u2018Partnership for Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) for people, planet and climate\u2019, which will also support living labs.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project <a href=\"http://soilwise-he.eu\">SoilWISE</a>. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/new-push-european-democracy/long-term-vision-rural-areas_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/new-push-european-democracy/long-term-vision-rural-areas_en</a></p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>International Agroecosystem Living Laboratories Working Group.
