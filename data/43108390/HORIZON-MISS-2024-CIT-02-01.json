In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.</p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission Label</strong></p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts (CCC)</strong> are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission \u201c100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030\u201d. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it \u2013 the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.</p><p>As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a <strong>Mission Label</strong> \u201cto the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC\u201d. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.</p><p>A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#documents\">Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)</a></p><p>]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: <strong>the Main Commitment Part</strong> which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; <strong>the Climate Neutral Action Plan</strong> which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the <strong>Climate</strong> <strong>Neutrality Investment Plan</strong> which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.</p><p>The Mission Platform will undertake a <strong>completeness check</strong> where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the <strong>co-creation process</strong> in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the <strong>Climate Neutrality Action Plan</strong> and the <strong>Climate Neutrality Investment Plan</strong>.</p><p>After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.</p><p>The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the <strong>consultation of the Mission Board</strong> and <strong>recommendation from the Mission Owners Group,</strong> the Mission Manager will decide whether to <strong>endorse</strong> the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.</p><p><strong>Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work Programme</strong></p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a> to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">UN Agenda 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">EU Zero Pollution Action Plan</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">Fit for 55 strategy</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en\">EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en\">the EU Industrial Strategy</a><u>, the </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/bioeconomy/bioeconomy-strategy_en\">EU Bioeconomy Strategy</a> and the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">New European Bauhaus initiative</a>. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.</p><p>Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&amp;I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);</li><li>engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;</li><li>developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. </li><li>rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;</li><li>delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;</li><li>exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;</li><li>fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability.</li> </ul><p>The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en</a>]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.</p><p>Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.</p><p>Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&amp;I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.</p><p>Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.</p><p>The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.</p><p>In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.</p><p>Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;</li><li>Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity;</li><li>Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects;</li><li>Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral;</li><li>Improved urban public space connectivity and accessibility of different urban districts and neighbourhoods by integrating multimodality and new (shared) services within the urban public space layout and infrastructure;</li><li>Improved methods for assessing exposure to air, water, soil &amp;
