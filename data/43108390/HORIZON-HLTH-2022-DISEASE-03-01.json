Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare\u2019 </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>h</em><em>ealth care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety\u2019</em></span>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, and <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em>.</p><p><span>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs</span>[[<span>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated \u20ac115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).</span>]]<span>. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions</span>[[<span>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.</span>]]<span>.</span></p><p><span>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</span></p><p><span>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission\u2019s political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policy-making; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</span></p><p><span>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil security for society\u201d</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical counter measures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>\u201cFood, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment\u201d</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health).</span></p><p><span>Some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the announced \u201cEurope\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan\u201d</span>[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan\"><span>https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</span></a>]]<span>, contributing to actions covering the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)</span>[[<span>https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</span>]]<span>. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.</span></p><p><u><span>Expected impacts: </span></u></p><p><span>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care.

Special attention will be placed on engaging with and including many research funders with relatively small budgets.</span></p><p><span>The Partnership will integrate research and innovation areas covered by previous ERANET co-fund actions, Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs), as well as IICSs. It will be composed of two phases.</span></p><p><span>Phase 1 will integrate European initiatives selected as most relevant by the partners</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup><span> and initially implement joint calls on nutrition- and lifestyle-related diseases, cardiovascular diseases and nano-medicine. In parallel, it will test the possibility to carry out joint calls for proposals for R&amp;I activities on IICSs. Phase 1 will last for 2 years. After this period, the Horizon Europe Health Programme Committee will decide whether to extend and intensify the focus on IICSs. This decision will be based on objective criteria to be specified in the final proposals. They will only affect the focus area and budget of the partnership, not its existence over the 7 years.</span></p><p><span>Phase 1 will start by co-creating an accepted and effective governance mechanism to achieve the following objectives:</span></p><p><span>1. To jointly identify and implement a common good/best practice funding strategy in priority areas of common interest and European benefit to advance health research and develop innovation. Partners will implement jointly calls to be funded each year. These will prioritize areas that are not adequately covered by (or can complement) existing programmes (i.e. Horizon Europe Work Programmes, other existing or planned partnerships and other actions).</span></p><p><span>2. To define and have a first measure of coordinated investment in Public Health Research for the European Research Area (EU and Associated countries). This entails agreeing towards the end of Phase 1, on (i) boundaries (what is and what is not \u201cHealth research\u201d), (ii) a taxonomy (which programmes are in or out) and (iii) a methodology according to the JOREP</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup><span> data, JRC and EUROSTAT standards for measuring the baseline of this Key Performance Indicator.</span></p><p><span>3. To develop new approaches that overcome known bottlenecks and challenges to implement multinational IICS. This will be achieved in close collaboration with ongoing initiatives</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup><span> to support the conduct of multinational non-commercial studies. This would result in establishing appropriate mechanism(s) to identify topics, pool-funding sources, and to launch (joint) calls for EU wide multinational IICSs on various health interventions</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup><span> addressing important public health needs.</span></p><p><span>By the end of Phase 1, all necessary procedures and support should be operational to launch a first call for IICSs involving several countries on selected health interventions that address important public health needs.</span></p><p><span>During Phase 2, additional multinational calls for IICSs and joint calls for other priority areas will be launched in accordance with the decision of the Health Programme Committee taken at the end of Phase 1 on the focus of the Partnership and the distribution of the budget between IICSs and other areas.</span></p><p><span>The Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) 536/2014 will become applicable in January 2022. The overall aim of the new Regulation is to make Europe more attractive for clinical trials. With these changes, the Regulation intends to provide additional support to multinational trials. As a new concept, it also introduces low-interventional trials (e.g. pragmatic trials to optimise treatment) with risk-proportionate regulatory requirements. This type of trials can also be supported by actions of this partnership.</span></p><p><span>The continuously growing arsenal of health interventions, whether it is a new pharmaceutical product, a medical device, a surgical intervention, or other measures utilised during health and care provision, reflecting the increasing demand for better quality of care by citizens, force decision makers of public health systems to optimally allocate limited resources in a well-informed manner. Large-scale IICSs generate data on safety and effectiveness of a health intervention, often in real-world settings, and thus provide evidence to answer questions that clinicians face in their day-to-day practice in order to optimise the clinical management of patients beyond the context of marketing authorisation application for medicinal products. Such studies deal with potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that do not attract, or could go counter commercial interest. These clinical studies are critical to support endorsement of healthcare strategies (repurposing, comparative effectiveness, treatment combination or optimisation studies, personalised medicine trials).</span></p><p><span>By pooling existing resources, eliminating redundancies and reducing fragmentation, the implementation of multinational IICSs covered by this Partnership will benefit from better access to high number of study participants/patients, medical expertise and facilities, enhanced methodological standards; and shared costs, tools and procedures. All these aspects will contribute to generate robust and reliable clinical evidence, increase the potential for broad implementation of research outcomes; prevent duplication of research efforts and allow broad uptake by health systems.</span></p><p><span>IICSs supported by this partnership should i) establish new indications of a given existing health intervention for a condition where alternative solutions do not exist or are sub-optimal; ii) optimise or develop new, personalised care pathways including for high-priced medical interventions/treatment modalities; iii) introduce new health interventions with clear relative clinical efficacy/effectiveness compared to existing alternatives (including preventative measures); iv) accelerate the uptake of new interventions by health care systems.</span></p><p><span>Support by European research infrastructures, required to perform multinational clinical studies at scale, will, in particular, build on the asset of existing research infrastructures, such as the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN)</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn7 id=r7>[7]</a></sup><span> for sponsor-delegated study responsibilities, and Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI)</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn8 id=r8>[8]</a></sup><span> for the management of biosamples and linked data that are generated under the studies.</span></p><p><span>The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future.
