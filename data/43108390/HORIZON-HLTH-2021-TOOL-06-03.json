Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <i>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019 </i>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<i>Health technologies, new tools and digital solutions are applied effectively thanks to their inclusive, secure and ethical development, delivery, integration and deployment in health policies and health and care systems\u2019</i>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <i>\u2018A competitive and secure data-economy\u2019</i>, <i>\u2018Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people\u2019</i>, and <i>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019</i>.</p><p>Technology is a key driver for innovation in the health care sector. It can provide better and more cost-efficient solutions with high societal impact, tailored to the specific health care needs of the individual. However, novel tools, therapies, technologies and digital approaches face specific barriers and hurdles in piloting, implementing and scaling-up before reaching the patient, encountering additional challenges such as public acceptance and trust. Emerging and disruptive technologies offer big opportunities for transforming health care, thereby promoting the health and well-being of citizens. Unlocking this potential and harnessing the opportunities depends on the capacity to collect, integrate and interpret large amounts of data, as well as ensure compatibility with appropriate regulatory frameworks and infrastructures that will both safeguard the rights of the individual and of society and stimulate innovation to develop impactful solutions. In addition to existing European Research Infrastructures, the European Health Data Space will promote health-data exchange and facilitate cross-border research activities. This destination aims to promote the development of tools, technologies and digital solutions for treatments, medicines, medical devices and improved health outcomes, taking into consideration safety, effectiveness, appropriateness, accessibility, comparative value-added and fiscal sustainability as well as issues of ethical, legal and regulatory nature.</p><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe) or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe).

Sharing and analysing data from multiple countries in a safe and legally compliant manner (in particular with regard to personal data protection) remains a challenge. Powerful analytic tools are already helping providers to use structured data in increasingly impactful ways. On the other hand, the heterogeneity, diversity of sources, quality of data and various representations of unstructured data in health care increase the number of challenges as compared to structured data.</span></p><p><span>Advances in AI and machine learning, however, have the potential to transform the way clinicians, providers and researchers use unstructured data. Furthermore, developing data interoperability standards, trust and harmonization of GDPR\u2019s interpretation across the EU for the sharing and processing of personal health data will support establishing a sound health data culture in view of the European Health Data Space.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should address all of the following aspects:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Developing robust novel solutions compliant with legal requirements (in particular concerning personal data protection) that will improve the quality, interoperability, machine-readability and re-use of health data and metadata in compliance with FAIR data management principles, making these data more accessible to clinicians, researchers and citizens. The focus should be on data in electronic health records (EHRs) and/or patient registries, taking into account the Commission Recommendation on a European Electronic Health Record exchange format</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup><span>.</span></li><li><span>Developing innovative natural language processing tools, including computational semantics, ontologies, text mining, associated machine learning and deep learning, to improve accessibility, interoperability, translation, transcription, and analysis of health data (e.g. to predict risks). Tools should extract health information from unstructured data in different clinical and medical sources, and bring that data into EHRs/patient registries in a structured form. The innovative solutions should also address missing data in EHRs and/or patient registries and their related metadata, to reduce bias and improve the quality of conclusions.</span></li><li><span>Developing and piloting AI-powered virtual assistants that will utilise the tools and solutions developed (as mentioned above) in order to demonstrate improved usability of health data for end-users. </span></li> </ul><p><span>Proposals are expected to build on and contribute to existing European and international data standards, specifications and schemas for health data. The use of open standards should be considered and interactions with relevant ongoing research infrastructure efforts are encouraged. Applicants should focus on health data coming from a number of EU Member States and EEA countries, constituting as much as possible a representative sample of the European healthcare landscape, so as to contribute to the work on the creation of the European Health Data Space.</span></p><p><span>To guarantee their adoption, the developed solutions should be quick and easy to use by researchers and clinicians. Therefore active involvement of end-users from the onset is encouraged. In particular, patient advocacy groups and citizens should be involved to ensure adequate consideration of diverse patient needs, with respect to their gender, ethnicity, age, ability, and socio-economic background, to underpin acceptance by patients and other data subjects. SMEs participation is also encouraged.</span></p><p><span>The proposals should duly take into account requirements stipulated in the relevant European regulations (Data protection, <em>in vitro</em> diagnostics and medical devices) and must meet appropriate ethical standards.</span></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=EoscAndFairData;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">EOSC and FAIR data</a><br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SSH;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Socio-economic science and humanities</a><br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><span>FAIR data are data, which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.</span></p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a><u><span>https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/recommendation-european-electronic-health-record-exchange-format</span></u></p>", "conditions": "<p><b><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:&#xA;11.0pt;line-height:115%;mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span style=\"mso-ansi-language:EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\">1.
