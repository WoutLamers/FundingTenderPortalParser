In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.</p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission Label</strong></p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts (CCC)</strong> are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission \u201c100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030\u201d. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it \u2013 the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.</p><p>As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a <strong>Mission Label</strong> \u201cto the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC\u201d. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.</p><p>A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#documents\">Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)</a></p><p>]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: <strong>the Main Commitment Part</strong> which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; <strong>the Climate Neutral Action Plan</strong> which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the <strong>Climate</strong> <strong>Neutrality Investment Plan</strong> which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.</p><p>The Mission Platform will undertake a <strong>completeness check</strong> where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the <strong>co-creation process</strong> in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the <strong>Climate Neutrality Action Plan</strong> and the <strong>Climate Neutrality Investment Plan</strong>.</p><p>After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.</p><p>The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the <strong>consultation of the Mission Board</strong> and <strong>recommendation from the Mission Owners Group,</strong> the Mission Manager will decide whether to <strong>endorse</strong> the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.</p><p><strong>Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work Programme</strong></p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">European Green Deal</a> to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda\">UN Agenda 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/zero-pollution-action-plan_en\">EU Zero Pollution Action Plan</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">Fit for 55 strategy</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</a>, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/adaptation/what_en\">EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change</a><u>, </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en\">the EU Industrial Strategy</a><u>, the </u><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/environment/bioeconomy/bioeconomy-strategy_en\">EU Bioeconomy Strategy</a> and the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en\">New European Bauhaus initiative</a>. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.</p><p>Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&amp;I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);</li><li>engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;</li><li>developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. </li><li>rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;</li><li>delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;</li><li>exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;</li><li>fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability.</li> </ul><p>The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en</a>]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.</p><p>Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.</p><p>Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&amp;I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.</p><p>Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.</p><p>The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.</p><p>In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.</p><p>Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;</li><li>Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems,

expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Better understanding of schemes\u2019 conditions and users\u2019 motivations leading to the uptake of urban mobility management schemes, including identification of levers as well as of challenges and barriers preventing their rapid and wide replication and uptake;</li><li>Enhanced societal acceptance (e.g. measured by actual uptake) of mobility management schemes by relevant categories of \u201cdestination\u201d organisations and their users: e.g. schools, universities, hospitals and other health facilities, tourism and leisure sectors, shopping malls, private companies;</li><li>Shift towards low- and zero-emission means of mobility, such as active mobility (e.g. walking and cycling), public transport, shared mobility services or micromobility and a decrease in the use of motorised vehicles, in particularly internal combustion engine driven ones (e.g. through low emission zones);</li><li>Broader acceptance and uptake of smart and bi-directional electric vehicle recharging of electric vehicles to alleviate the need to invest in distribution grid extension due to the increase in the number of electric vehicles used in cities, and to facilitate locally powered zero-emission mobility in cities across electric mobility modes including public transport;</li><li>Guidelines and recommendations for national, regional and local authorities, EU institutions, public and private organisations, introducing the benefits of mobility management schemes and how relevant policy levers and regulations facilitate travels' behaviour change and support sustainable mobility choices by different mobility management scheme users.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The shift towards a decarbonised transport system is considered as challenging compared to other sectors of the economy. Achieving urban mobility decarbonisation can involve a variety of policy and technology measures and solutions. However, technological innovations alone are not sufficient for achieving a decarbonised urban transport system. They should be complemented by measures tapping into changes that target travel patterns and generate a shift in the daily mobility behaviour.</p><p>Urban mobility management plans are developed by organisations in the public domain (by local and regional authorities) and the private domain (companies, organisations, and institutions) to promote sustainable urban transport as laid out in the Urban Mobility Framework<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> to reach climate neutrality, reduce congestion, air pollutant emissions, noise and other harmful effects of overreliance on fossil fuels-based transport.</p><p>In the context of consultations for the preparation of the new Urban Mobility Framework, the support for mobility management plans has been voiced, with a majority of the respondents being in favour of adopting those plans by \u201ctravel destination\u201d such as organisers of big events, companies with more than 200 employees, universities, shopping centres/retail areas, primary and secondary schools as well as hospitals.</p><p>It is not clear however how many mobility management schemes exist. When they exist, they seem not always fully taken up by their target users. In consequence, they do not lead to the desired behavioural change resulting in a shift towards sustainable mobility choices. Therefore, projects should identify and address specific bottlenecks and barriers that prevent the uptake of sustainable mobility management schemes across the EU and propose solutions that could lead to the desired behaviour change of citizens, aimed at more sustainable and decarbonised urban transport with all its related co-benefits in view of decarbonising the transport sector in line with the European Green Deal.</p><p>A closely related challenge is the uptake of electromobility that requires an increase for clean electricity and the related infrastructure enhancement, notably distribution grids in cities. It is relevant to promote vehicle-to-grid solutions, to alleviate the needs to invest in distribution grid extension. In this regard, behavioural change is key to enable and incentivise electric vehicles users to participate in balancing the grid through smart and bidirectional charging.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to explore, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of mobility management schemes (influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply) in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system. To this end, projects should:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way and provide an overview of mobility managements schemes in the European urban area in both the public and the private domain, which seek to increase the use of sustainable transport modes infrastructure;</li><li>Identify, analyse and assess leverages as well as barriers in the uptake of mobility management schemes for the most important target groups;</li><li>Co-design with and engaging the organisations proposing the mobility schemes, identify and assess potential behaviour-related solutions to those barriers that ensure a successful uptake of mobility management systems. Those solutions should differentiate between specific target groups, in particular students, employees, customers and patients of relevant categories of organisations: schools, universities, hospitals and other health facilities, tourism and leisure sectors, shopping malls, private companies, living in European urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Identify user groups that are more motivated to change their behaviours and prepared to act as frontrunners, thus leading to a more rapid adoption;</li><li>Propose recommendations that support and incentivise the uptake of sustainable mobility choices by organisations and users;</li><li>Propose recommendations to support the uptake of smart and bidirectional recharging for electric vehicles and related demand side management schemes in cities to enable electric vehicles (EV) participation in electricity markets as active customers that can feed the electricity stored in EV batteries back to the power grid during the peak hours to help balance the growing the electricity demand (thus avoiding need for investments into grids);</li><li>Establish incentives to promote renewable based e-mobility schemes notably smart and bidirectional charging in cities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels including via support and awareness raising schemes;</li><li>Encourage new mobility behaviour by means of marketing, information and awareness raising campaigns.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
