Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <i>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019 </i>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<i>living and working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better understanding of environmental, occupational, social and economic determinants of health\u2019</i>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <i>\u2018Good health and high quality accessible health care\u2019</i>, <i>\u2018Climate change mitigation and </i>adaptation\u2019, and <i>\u2018</i>Clean<i> and healthy air, water and soil\u2019</i>.</p><p>The environment we live and work in is a major determinant of our health and well-being. It has direct or indirect beneficial or adverse impact on our health and well-being. Environmental factors are estimated to account for almost 20% of all deaths in Europe. Opinion surveys have shown that European citizens are concerned about the impact of pollution on their health. The impacting factors on both physical and mental health and well-being are not all identified nor their effects comprehensively understood and accounted for to support evidence-based policy- and decision-making. Furthermore, agreed methodologies to estimate health-related costs of exposure to environmental stressors are lacking.</p><p>Therefore, Destination 2 aims at filling knowledge gaps in the understanding of the impacts on our health and well-being of those environmental, occupational and socio-economic risk factors that have the most significant or widespread societal impacts. In this work programme, Destination 2 focuses on indoor and outdoor air pollution, chemicals, non-ionizing radiation (electromagnetic fields), urbanisation, climate and other environmental changes, socio-economic inequalities, and changing working environments. Furthermore, under this work programme a topic is dedicated to the creation of a European partnership for the assessment of risks from chemicals, which should establish the EU as an internationally recognised driver of innovative chemical risk assessment for an optimal protection of human health and the environment. The results will support the EU\u2019s environment and health policies and overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal, the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the 8th Environment Action Programme, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work as well as the WHO European Environment and Health Process (EHP).</p><p>Strong collaborations across sectors and with other Horizon Europe clusters dealing with issues such as agriculture, food, environment, climate, mobility, security, urban planning, social inclusion and gender will be needed to ensure that maximal societal benefits are reached. Thus, in view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe).</p><p>All topics are open to international collaboration to address global environment and health challenges.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to living and working in a health-promoting environment, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Policy-makers and regulators are aware and well informed about environmental, socio-economic and occupational risk factors as well as health-promoting factors across society;</li><li>Environmental, occupational, social, economic, fiscal and health policies and practices at the EU, national and regional level are sustainable and based on solid scientific evidence.

It also aims to protect, conserve and enhance the EU's natural capital, and protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts. In addition to aiming for climate neutrality by 2050, the Commission adopted a more ambitious EU strategy on adaptation to climate change on 24 February 2021. This is essential, as climate change will continue to create significant stress in Europe in spite of the mitigation efforts. </span></p><p><span>The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause at least 250 000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup><span>. Climate change, together with other natural and man-made health stressors, can influence human health and disease patterns in numerous ways. Some existing health threats will intensify and new health threats will emerge, with variable impact on different socio-economic groups. Climate changes induce events such as changes in biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, habitats and land use, global warming and heat waves, changes in UV exposure or flooding. These events are influencing globally the incidence and spread of infectious diseases and increasing pollution, thereby causing new threats to human health. </span></p><p><span>The aim of this topic is the identification, monitoring and quantification of direct and indirect impacts on human health, including in occupational settings, and related risk factors correlated to climate change, especially in vulnerable population groups such as children or in groups at risk such as workers. Innovative surveillance tools are further required to ensure a timely response to emerging threats, to feed and strengthen early warning systems, and to enable the design, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. This may include mathematical modelling with big data and artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, citizen science and biomarkers of exposure or virulence.</span></p><p><span>Proposals must choose and address one of the following areas of research: </span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Research on the relationships between changes in environmental hazards caused by climate change, the impacts on interrelated ecosystems and their influence on human health;</span></li><li><span>Climate induced emergence and transmission of pathogens and spread of zoonotic pathogens using Eco-health</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup><span> and One Health</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup><span> approaches. </span></li> </ul><p><span>Proposals should include all of the following activities: </span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Development of suitable indicators and monitoring mechanisms to assess the health-relevant outcomes of climate policies and actions;</span></li><li><span>Development of predictive models and early warning systems for exposure and health impacts of climate change based on transparent assumptions and architecture;</span></li><li><span>Development of tools for health impact and cost-benefit assessment of climate-change adaptation and mitigation measures;</span></li><li><span>Investigation of health co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation policy measures outside the health sector; </span></li><li><span>Demonstration of the validity of tools and methods developed in the above listed activities in policy-relevant case studies;</span></li><li><span>Determination of the societal implications of climate change on health systems, including occupational health, and development of adaptation measures;</span></li><li><span>Development of training materials and guidelines to educate relevant actors in citizens\u2019 daily life on climate change health impacts and to facilitate adaptation of health systems and practices;</span></li><li><span>Delivery of FAIR</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup><span> data on positive and negative health impacts of climate change, including impact on groups at higher risk or vulnerability. </span></li> </ul><p><span>International cooperation is encouraged with the specific aim to support international climate policies.
