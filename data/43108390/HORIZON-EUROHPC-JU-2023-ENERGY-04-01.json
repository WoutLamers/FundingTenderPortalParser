The action will ensure a common framework for implementation by maintaining an R&amp;I roadmap with a critical timeline, control points and deliverables to govern the necessary activities.</p><p>Proposals should provide a holistic view on the entire energy aware software stack, including a dynamic resource and workload management solution for energy aware HPC, a comprehensive monitoring and profiling framework adhering to a common data format. Participants must commit to work towards a common standard and solution to address the challenges of energy efficiency, monitoring and resource scheduling at exascale. All participating HPC centres should gradually adopt the common solution once the required quality level has been reached which should be measures by appropriate KPIs. The developed solution should integrate an advanced data analytics solution providing the basis for automated intelligent decisions on scheduling, dynamic resource allocation, job and application configuration. The data driven solution should provide capabilities significantly beyond the state of the art, considering recent developments in the fields of modelling and optimisation, data science, deep learning and generative AI. Moreover, the solution should identify user input and applications resulting in inefficient use of resources to provide automated feedback on the optimal use of resources.</p><p>In general, the pursued approach following the principles of modularity, interoperability, cross-platform compatibility (avoid vendor lock in and prepare for new architectures such as RISC-V based hardware), extensibility (e. g. via plugins) and openness (e. g. by permissive licensing). Another important design principle should be a low impact on system performance with negligible overhead on the compute nodes. Consequently, the definition of interfaces and software documentation should receive proportionate attention in the work plan which should also be reflected in corresponding quantitative KPIs. Where appropriate, proposals should take into account developments in other related activities outside the EuroHPC ecosystem where relevant, for example efforts of the HPC-PowerStack and PowerAPI forums.</p><p>All significant software components should be subject to a professional planning and documentation process, including at least software requirements specification, software design description, software verification and validation as well as user and developer documentation for every developed software component.</p><p>Proposals should indicate, for each participating HPC centre, the current energy consumption with respect to the current throughput and portfolio of applications (on average, expressed in Gflops/Watt) and an estimated overall reduction of energy consumption by the end of the action when the software stack is expected to be used in production.</p><p>While the resulting software stack should generally provide support for malleable applications and workflows, the scope of the initiative is delimited by system software such as the operating system on the one hand and, on the other hand, the boundaries to user space software and applications, including, for example, programming models, software libraries and applications.</p><p>The selection of the software stack must avoid duplicated or redundant elements. An indicative list of software components envisaged should be provided in the proposal explaining their specific role. The JU provides a specific template for this purpose. Alternative solutions overlapping with the role or responsibilities of a component in the consolidated reference implementation may be used by individual partners, but no resources will be made available for activities linked to such components within this action. However participants should be invited to use the continuous integration platform free of charge to integrate their tailored solutions as an alternative into the common software stack.</p><p>All developed software and documentation should be available in a single software repository using a state of the art version control system which provides information on the development history and is accessible at least by all members of the consortium, the funding authority and external reviewers. Measures for Continuous Integration that verify dependencies between software packages before deployment should be applied. The requirements set out in the call must be reflected in the proposal as well as in corresponding deliverables and milestones. The work plan should provide for updates of deliverables whenever necessary.</p><p><strong><u>Requirements</u></strong></p><p><strong>General requirements, interoperability, harmonization and standardisation:</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Develop a common vision and technology roadmap towards an integrated and modular scheduling and resource management framework, including one common and complete software stack (a selection of one set of existing and to be developed components providing non-overlapping functionality) that fulfils best the requirements of all participating HPC operators.</li><li>Maintain a detailed strategic development roadmap for the action, anticipating future developments in HPC architectures and increasing heterogeneity, including emerging technologies such as quantum computing resources.

Besides the required track record of each consortium member in the respective field, also the management team should demonstrate the relevant competences. To this end, the consortium is expected to appoint a general manager, with the respective professional competence and experience for the implementation, monitoring and management of complex software development projects. The management team is expected to work closely together with funding authority, reporting any (anticipated) changes in the roadmap and timeline without undue delay.</p><p>The consortium must include all required competences and operational capacity to perform the proposed work and to achieve the objectives set out by the call. In particular, the participation of HPC centres is critical for the required deployment of the solution in a production environment.</p><p>The participation of private companies, e. g. offering professional services for HPC is highly encouraged. However the software used and developed within a proposal should offer a permissive licencing model. Exceptions should be duly justified and reviewed on a regular basis during the implementation of the work. A data sheet for each significant software component should be provided according to the application template documents<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup>.</p><p>HPC centres that participate in the action must commit to</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Contribute to the definition of the solutions developed by the action through specifications and requirements justified by their individual operational constraints</li><li>Implement the common standards and interoperability requirements defined and adopted by the consortium during the project</li><li>Provide all required data for the common data repository and within the applicable legislation. If operational or user generated data, e. g. application input, cannot be provided due to legal or contractual agreements, this must be notified and duly justified to the coordinator who will inform the granting authority. A sanitised dataset must be provided in such case.</li><li>Deploy the developed solutions to the production environment as soon as the solution has passed the common acceptance criteria defined by the consortium. Where technically possible, individual modules should be deployed as early as possible and before the implementation of entire software stack has been completed. If a participating HPC centre deviates from the reference solution defined in the proposal, e. g. by replacing a module with an alternative solution, this should be explained and justified in the respective deliverable and progress report.</li> </ul><p>The participation of HPC centres requires that all legal aspects related to the sharing of data must be clarified and sufficiently detailed evidence on the ability to share all relevant data must be provided to the granting authority before the signature of the grant agreement</p><p>Proposals should also clearly demonstrate that all partners in the consortium have a significant and justified role, including appropriate deliverables under their responsibility which cover the specific contributions of each partner. All participants in the action should contribute at least 5% of the total personnel resources, limiting the total consortium size to a maximum of 20 participants. Additionally, the contribution of each partner participating in the implementation of a particular technical area identified in the call (workload manager, monitoring framework, data driven analytics) should not be less than 2 full-time equivalents (FTEs). The consortium is required to establish an effective management structure with clear responsibilities and well defined reporting lines without boundaries across different participating organization. Moreover, the proposal should, in cooperation with the EuroHPC JU, develop and implement a mechanism for the efficient monitoring by the funding authority with meaningful progress reporting at least on a monthly basis. The status of the implementation should be available to the competent funding authority and every participant in the project at any time, e. g. via an issue tracking and ticketing system, dashboard, backlog, results from automated testing and similar as provided by standard continuous integration solutions.</p><p><strong>Additional mandatory KPIs</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Number of deployed components from common software stack with breakdown by pre-production, production environment and per HPC system</li><li>Test coverage for the developed components and APIs</li><li>Resource utilization and energy efficiency improvement of the solution on a per-job and workload basis</li> </ul><p>The JU considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 20 million and a duration of 4 years would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting another duration or other amounts. Only one proposal will be selected.</p><p><u><strong>Background:</strong></u></p><p>The operation of supercomputers consumes a considerable amount of energy. Modern exascale class supercomputers reach electricity intakes of more than 20MW. Besides technical challenges associated to stable electricity supply, infrastructure or heat dissipation, also the economic and environmental aspects are of outstanding importance in the context of energy efficiency. Without effective measures for energy efficient technology and HPC operations, costs for the operation of supercomputers may become prohibitively expensive and impact availability and use of HPC infrastructure.</p><p>In line with its mission<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> and strategic programme<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, the EuroHPC JU addresses energy efficiency and environmental sustainability across the entire HPC technology stack, for example through low-power hardware technology, dynamic power-saving and re-use techniques like advanced cooling and heat recycling. While the challenge of energy efficiency has many dimensions across the entire value chain of HPC, the relevant metrics for the EuroHPC infrastructure can be broadly defined as R&amp;D output per Watt. Hence improving the amount and quality of R&amp;D output per Watt is a central objective in the JU\u2019s ambition towards a more energy efficient HPC ecosystem in Europe.</p><p>Currently perhaps the largest potential for improving energy efficiency is available in the areas of user competence and the responsible use of resources, algorithms and applications, and system operation. The JU addresses these areas with several initiatives such as the EUROCC 2 (user competence), Inno4Scale (algorithms), Centres of Excellence in HPC applications (applications) and the REGALE, DEEP and SEA projects (system software). However so far, the JU has achieved limited harmonisation and uptake of a common software stack for a more energy efficient system operation of the EuroHPC supercomputers, which is critical to address the cross-cutting topic of energy efficient HPC operation in a coherent manner.</p><p>The beginning of the exascale supercomputing era with compute nodes of increasing size and heterogeneous system architectures offers unprecedented opportunities to develop intelligent scheduling mechanisms for an improved global throughput and overall energy efficiency. Recent developments in advanced modelling, deep learning and generative AI may provide the required intelligence for smart scheduling, workload configurations and user assistance to optimise performance and energy efficiency. In this regard, the availability of a comprehensive data set is a key requirement for the development of advanced techniques for energy aware and energy efficient supercomputing. The EuroHPC JU has put in place one of the largest supercomputing infrastructures in the world, which offers a unique opportunity to place Europe at the forefront of intelligent data driven and energy efficient HPC operation.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><sup> </sup>Only software components which are owned or controlled by the consortium members are eligible.

Modern exascale class supercomputers reach electricity intakes of more than 20MW. Besides technical challenges associated to stable electricity supply, infrastructure or heat dissipation, also the economic and environmental aspects are of outstanding importance in the context of energy efficiency. Without effective measures for energy efficient technology and HPC operations, costs for the operation of supercomputers may become prohibitively expensive and impact availability and use of HPC infrastructure.</p><p>In line with its mission[[<sup> </sup>Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1173 of 13 July 2021 on establishing the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking and repealing Regulation (EU) 2018/1488,</p><p><a href=\"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/1173/oj\">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2021/1173/oj</a>]] and strategic programme[[<sup> </sup>EuroHPC JU Decision No 8/2023</p><p>https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/system/files/2023-06/Decision%2008_2023_%20Amendment%20MASP%202021-2027_0.pdf]], the EuroHPC JU addresses energy efficiency and environmental sustainability across the entire HPC technology stack, for example through low-power hardware technology, dynamic power-saving and re-use techniques like advanced cooling and heat recycling. While the challenge of energy efficiency has many dimensions across the entire value chain of HPC, the relevant metrics for the EuroHPC infrastructure can be broadly defined as R&amp;D output per Watt. Hence improving the amount and quality of R&amp;D output per Watt is a central objective in the JU\u2019s ambition towards a more energy efficient HPC ecosystem in Europe.</p><p>Currently perhaps the largest potential for improving energy efficiency is available in the areas of user competence and the responsible use of resources, algorithms and applications, and system operation. The JU addresses these areas with several initiatives such as the EUROCC 2 (user competence), Inno4Scale (algorithms), Centres of Excellence in HPC applications (applications) and the REGALE, DEEP and SEA projects (system software). However so far, the JU has achieved limited harmonisation and uptake of a common software stack for a more energy efficient system operation of the EuroHPC supercomputers, which is critical to address the cross-cutting topic of energy efficient HPC operation in a coherent manner.</p><p>The beginning of the exascale supercomputing era with compute nodes of increasing size and heterogeneous system architectures offers unprecedented opportunities to develop intelligent scheduling mechanisms for an improved global throughput and overall energy efficiency. Recent developments in advanced modelling, deep learning and generative AI may provide the required intelligence for smart scheduling, workload configurations and user assistance to optimise performance and energy efficiency. In this regard, the availability of a comprehensive data set is a key requirement for the development of advanced techniques for energy aware and energy efficient supercomputing. The EuroHPC JU has put in place one of the largest supercomputing infrastructures in the world, which offers a unique opportunity to place Europe at the forefront of intelligent data driven and energy efficient HPC operation.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Nov 7, 2023 6:00:19 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 7, 2023 6:00:19 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: HORIZON-EUROHPC-JU-2023-ENERGY-04-01(HORIZON-JU-RIA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
