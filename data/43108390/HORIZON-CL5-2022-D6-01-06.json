In particular, the areas of infrastructure, logistics and network/traffic management play a major role in making mobility and transport climate neutral, also through the digitalisation of the sectors. At the same time, being vulnerable to climate change and other disruptions, resilience in these three areas need to be increased. New and advanced infrastructures across all transport modes are required to enable the introduction of new vehicles, operations and mobility services. Furthermore, efficient and smart multimodal logistics are key for seamless and sustainable long-haul, regional and urban freight transport movements. Finally, dynamic multimodal network and traffic management systems are the \u201cglue\u201d of the entire transport network, for optimised door-to-door mobility of both passengers and freight.</p><p>To test solutions related to multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and good, applicants may seek possibilities of involving the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) in order to valorise the relevant expertise and physical facilities of JRC in demonstrating and testing energy and mobility applications of the JRC Living Lab for Future Urban Ecosystems[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc\">https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-facility/living-labs-at-the-jrc</a>]].</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting Multimodal and sustainable transport systems for passengers and goods under this Destination are:</p><ul><li>Upgraded and resilient physical and digital infrastructure for clean, accessible, affordable, connected and automated multimodal mobility.</li><li>Sustainable and smart long-haul, regional and urban freight transport and logistics, through increased efficiency, improved interconnectivity and smart enforcement.</li><li>Reduced external costs (e.g. congestion, traffic jams, emissions, air and noise pollution, road collisions) of urban, peri-urban (regional) and long distance freight transport as well as optimised system-wide network efficiency and resilience.</li><li>Enhanced local and/or regional capacity for governance and innovation in urban mobility and logistics.</li></ul><p><i><strong><u>Safety and resilience - per mode and across all transport modes</u></strong></i></p><p>Safety and resilience are of primary concern for any transport system. The EU set ambitious targets in its 2011 Transport White Paper, the third Mobility Package and, more recently, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy[[COM(2020) 789 final.]]. COVID-19 has been a stark reminder of the importance of resilience to external disruptions, particularly for transport. Research and innovation will underpin the three pillars affecting safety and resilience: technologies; regulations (alongside acceptable level of risks); and human factors (individual and organisational aspects, including interaction with automation). The approach is risk-based and systemic, including transport means/vehicles, infrastructure, the physical environment (e.g. weather) and the various actors (e.g. manufacturers, regulators, operators, users) as well as all their interfaces, including certification and standardisation bodies.</p><p>Synergies should be exploited across research at national, EU and international level together with national authorities, EU agencies and international organisations to improve rulemaking, safety promotion and oversight.</p><p>The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting transport safety and resilience under this Destination are:</p><p><i>Safety in Urban Areas/ Road Transport Safety</i></p><ul><li>50% reduction in serious injuries and fatalities in road crashes by 2030.</li><li>Improved reliability and performance of systems that aim to anticipate and minimize safety risks, avoiding risks and collisions, and reducing the consequences of unavoidable crashes.</li><li>Drastic reduction of road fatalities and serious crash injuries in low and medium income countries in Africa.</li><li>Better design principles of future road transport systems enabling also better traffic flow in big cities.</li></ul><p><i>Waterborne Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Ensure healthy passenger shipping by preventing and mitigating the spread of contagious diseases and infections.</li></ul><p><i>Aviation Safety and Resilience</i></p><ul><li>Decrease number of accidents and incidents due to organisational/human/automation factors and external hazards in all phases of flight, also beyond CAT category (80% goal in FlightPath2050), while enabling all weather operations.</li><li>Saving lives following a crash (post-crash survivability).</li><li>Anticipate emergence of new threats that could generate potential accidents and incidents (short, medium, and long term).</li><li>Ensure safety through aviation transformation (from green/digital technologies uptake up to independent certification).</li><li>Maintain safety and resilience despite the scale, pace and diversity of new entrants.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Safe, Resilient Transport and Smart Mobility services for passengers and goods", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["cycling", "traffic", "walking", "protection", "road safety", "vulnerability", "road user", "safe environment"], "keywords": ["Social Innovation", "Societal Engagement", "Transport engineering", "Digital Agenda", "Automotive engineering", "Artificial Intelligence", "Vehicle engineering", "Foresight", "Social sciences and humanities", "Mechanical engineering"], "flags": ["SocInnov", "SocietalEngagement", "DigitalAgenda", "AI", "FORESIGHT", "SSH"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-RIA HORIZON  Research and Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "14 October 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["12 January 2022"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3373358": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-08 -

The safe system approach requires a systematic, multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral, and multi-stakeholder approach which addresses the safety needs of all users; fatal and serious injury prevention, collision prevention and mitigation and post-collision care and aligns with other policies for co-benefits such as health, occupational health and safety, sustainable development and poverty </span><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">reduction. In a Safe System approach, mobility is a function of safety rather than vice versa. It involves the implementation of system-wide measures that ensure, in the event of a collision, that the impact forces remain below the thresholds likely to produce either death or serious injury.</span></p><p><strong><u><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Area A \u2013 Predictive safety assessment framework</span></u></strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">The road traffic system is changing with new technology, new means of transport as well as with regulatory and behavioural changes, and so will scenarios which are relevant for safety. Such future scenarios are not yet captured in accident databases. Traditional analysis methods and road studies can no longer predict the impact of new developments and new measures on road safety with an increased speed of technological development, but relatively slow penetration rates in the road traffic system. Also for already developed safety measures, scenarios need to be provided which cover more complex transport system levels where safety can be described in terms of risk and probability due to interplay between societal and technological driving forces as well as different stakeholder and user needs. A predictive safety assessment framework on higher system levels will support considerably the proactive management of road safety as an important principle of the safe system approach.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Virtual simulation allows for fast and extensive evaluation of safety measures even in scenarios which do not exist in real traffic yet. With growing computer power, safety assessment methods should therefore be extended to potential future scenarios and to the transport system level also allowing for the evaluation of socio-economic benefits. Such predictive assessment requires appropriate simulation environments and realistic models of all elements of the transport system (incl. human behaviour and traffic flow), which need to be harmonised to make them available for policy, regulatory and consumer assessment.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Within this context, actions should address the following aspects:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Develop new methods to efficiently predict the effects of the implementation of a new technology, new means of transport and regulatory or behavioural changes on road safety up to the level of socio-economic benefits.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Further develop virtual models of the relevant elements of the transport system for which such further development is most urgently needed, and validate them through testing activities and corresponding correlation.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Analyse, based on selected examples, how the application of new technology and/or the introduction of new regulation will affect the remaining road safety burden, and how traffic and crash scenarios will change with their market penetration and/or enforcement respectively</span><span>. </span></li> </ul><p><strong><u><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Area B \u2013 Safer urban environment for vulnerable road users</span></u></strong></p><p><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">A safe system strategy and targets to reduce accidents in urban areas inevitably should have at its core the safety of vulnerable road users. Vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists and powered two wheelers) constitute almost 70% of the fatalities from road crashes in urban areas. Our society is characterized by an ageing generation, which is still mobile and more active in road traffic than in the decades before, therefore it is of high importance to improve safety in road traffic for elderly people by seeking solutions that would concomitantly address infrastructure and road user behaviour. A safe system strategy needs also to take into account the interactions between different modes of transport, especially the road intersection with trams, light-rail, commuter rail, including infrastructure and human factors of vulnerable users in relation to level-crossings and trespassing.</span></p><p><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">In this context, building on best practices (technological, non-technological and social), as well as ongoing projects and planned initiatives in the area of safe urban environment for vulnerable road users, actions should address the following aspects:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Protection principles and solutions to provide a safe environment for vulnerable road users through infrastructure measures and lifelong learning initiatives for vulnerable road users as well as for vehicle occupants (behavioural change, training courses, road safety education from an early age)</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Identify specific mobility needs and public space design needs to promote a safe journey for the vulnerable road users, and enhance their perception of safety (considering among others </span><span>women\u2019s perception of safety </span><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">and people with disabilities, like blind people in shared spaces).</span></li><li><span style=\"color:#0D0D0D;\">Safe inclusion of </span><span>new means of transport into the traffic system (including personal light electric vehicles, PLEVs, such as electric scooters and self-balancing vehicles and the safe transition to higher levels of automation e.g. automated public transport vehicles ).
