Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019, </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em> and <em>\u2018A Competitive and secure data economy</em>\u2019.</span></p><p><span>Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems. </span></p><p><span>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and, consequently, allow improving governance of the European health care systems, supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens\u2019 health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</span></p><p><span>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Modernising health care systems in the EU, especially through a European public-public partnership on transforming health and care systems;</span></li><li><span>Improving the quality of health care along the entire health care continuum and being people-centred;</span></li><li><span>Supporting evidence-based health care decisions both for health care providers and policy-makers, fostering improved foresight and enabling sound planning of health care resources; </span></li><li><span>Enhancing development and uptake of innovative health care services and solutions, including environmentally sustainable ones that contribute to the European Green Deal. </span></li> </ul><p><span>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 <em>\u201cCulture, Creativity and Inclusive Society</em>\u201d such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil Security for Society\u201d</em> such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation).</span></p><p><u><span>Expected impacts:</span></u></p><p><span>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public health needs, while patient safety and quality of services is increased. </span></li><li><span>Health care providers are trained and equipped with the skills and competences suited for the future needs of health care systems that are modernised, digitally transformed and equipped with innovative tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care. They save time and resources by integrating and applying innovative technologies, which better involve patients in their own care, by reorganising workflows and redistributing tasks and responsibilities throughout the health care system, and by monitoring and analysing corresponding health care activities. </span></li><li><span>Citizens are supported to play a key role in managing their own health care, informal carers (including unpaid carers) are fully supported (e.g. by preventing overburdening and economic stress) and specific needs of more vulnerable groups are recognised and addressed. They benefit from improved access to health care services, including financial risk protection, timely access to quality essential health care services, including safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines. </span></li><li><span>Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities, organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making. </span></li><li><span>The actions resulting from the calls under this destination will also create strong opportunities for synergies with the EU4Health programme and in particular to contribute to the goals under general objectives 1a \u201cprotecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination among the Member States to cope with those threats\u201d and 3 \u201cstrengthening health systems by improving their resilience and resource efficiency, in particular through: i) supporting integrated and coordinated work between Member States; ii) promoting the implementation of best practices on data sharing; iii) reinforcing the healthcare workforce; iv) tackling the implications of demographic challenges; and v) advancing digital transformation\u201d.</span></li> </ul>", "destinationDescription": "Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["healthcare systems", "Co-fund", "healthcare system reform", "Innovation uptake", "Innovation transfer"], "keywords": ["Co-funded European Partnerships", "Social sciences and humanities", "Health policy and services", "Health care sciences and services (including hospi", "EOSC and FAIR data", "Artificial Intelligence", "Digital Agenda", "Technology transfer"], "flags": ["PART-COFUND", "SSH", "AI", "DigitalAgenda", "EoscAndFairData"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-COFUND HORIZON Programme Cofund Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "06 October 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["21 April 2022"]}], "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Aug 8, 2022 10:23:57 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Aug 8, 2022 10:23:57 AM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;We recently informed the applicants about the evaluation results for their proposals submitted under this call.

In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted existing structural weaknesses in health and care systems, and emphasised areas where not enough effort, planning and resources had been directed to. In addition, rapid technological and societal evolutions call for urgent responses to increasing demands and expectations from citizens. There is a need to accelerate the transition towards more efficient, sustainable, resilient, innovative and accessible health and care systems in Europe. To this end, the creation of a research and innovation (R&amp;I) partnership with a focus on health and care systems\u2019 transformation represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate R&amp;I actions, facilitate the digitization of health and care services and support the transformation of health and care systems with innovative solutions driven by knowledge and evidence. The partnership should build on knowledge gained from initiatives taken under Horizon 2020 (TO-REACH, Active and Assisted Living programme (AAL), Joint Programming Initiative More Years, Better, Lives (JPI MYBL), European Innovation partnership (EIP-AHA), ICPerMed, etc.). In order to increase the likelihood of successful system transformation, the partnership will facilitate exchange of information and good practices among countries, provide robust guidance and tools, network institutional stakeholders and involve regional ecosystems. It will stimulate service, policy and organisational innovations, as well as the integration of biomedical and technological innovations for the benefit of the European citizens and the European industry. Development of new products is beyond the scope of this Partnership. By laying the ground for the transformation of the health and care systems, the partnership will contribute to the transition of Europe to a more sustainable development and address emerging threats raised by environmental changes and globalisation.</span></p><p><span>The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future health and care systems.
