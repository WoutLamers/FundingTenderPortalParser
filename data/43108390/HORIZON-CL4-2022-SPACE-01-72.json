Space also makes important contributions to security crisis management and emergency services. These are key assets for the EU policies on climate, environment, transport, agriculture and secure society (e.g. Maritime Strategy, the Arctic Strategy, the Digital Agenda, the Common Security and Defence Policy, the Sustainable Development Strategy, the SGDGs). Finally, the space sector is a source of economic growth, jobs and exports.</p><p>This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations, as outlined in the Strategic Plan:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>KSO A, \u2018<strong>Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains</strong> to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.\u2019</li><li>KSO B,<strong> 'Restoring Europe\u2019s ecosystems and biodiversity, and managing sustainably natural resources</strong> to ensure food security and a clean and healthy environment.</li><li>KSO C, \u2018<strong>Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy</strong> through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems.\u2019</li><li>KSO D, \u2018<strong>Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, </strong>prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions.\u2019</li> </ul><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:</p><p><strong>Open strategic autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space-based infrastructures, services applications and data,</strong> including by reinforcing the EU\u2019s independent capacity to access space, securing the autonomy of supply for critical technologies and equipment, and fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness.</p><p>This expected impact is fully in line with the Space Strategy for Europe and the proposal for the Space Programme. Horizon Europe R&amp;I funds will contribute to this expected impact along 2 main axes by:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>providing support with R&amp;I funding to the EU space sector at large</li><li>making a specific impact with the EU action with R&amp;I to prepare the future evolutions of the Space programme components</li> </ul><p>This Destination is therefore structured along the following headings:</p><p>1 Foster competitiveness of space systems</p><p>2 Reinforce EU capacity to access to space</p><p>3 Evolution of Space and ground infrastructures for Galileo/EGNOS</p><p>4 Evolution of services: Copernicus</p><p>5 Development of applications for Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus</p><p>6 Innovative space capabilities: SSA, GOVSATCOM, Quantum</p><p>7 Space entrepreneurship ecosystems (incl. New Space and start-ups) and skills</p><p>Targeted and strategic actions supporting the EU space sector</p><p>While headings 1, 2, 7 and 8 will support the EU space sector at large and are largely based on the recommendation of the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda, headings 3), 4), 5), and 6) will be supporting the Space Programme components as well as the emerging quantum initiative.</p><p>All headings will contribute to the 'Open strategic autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space-based infrastructures'. This is the underlying goal when investing in R&amp;I to ensure the future of existing space programme component infrastructures, services and applications (Heading 3) and with R&amp;I to investigate new future services (Heading 4) or to develop innovative space capabilities such as SSA, GOVSATCOM and Quantum (Heading 6). This autonomy would however not be complete if we did not have the capacity to access space, to launch these infrastructures (Heading 2) and to propose opportunities for In-Orbit Demonstration and In-Orbit Validation (Heading 8). As the EU space sector relies on a smaller share of institutional investments compared to other regions, this difference needs to be compensated by a more competitive sector (Heading 1). R&amp;I and a strategy for critical technologies for non-dependence is another important axis of action (Heading 8). A guarantee for such autonomy is also to have a vivid and competitive downstream sector and entrepreneurship eco-systems in the EU (Headings 5 and Heading 7). A description of the headings objectives and targeted achievements is provided below.</p><p><strong><u>Foster competitiveness of space systems</u></strong></p><p>The European space sector and space economy need to improve space-based capabilities, capture new markets, adapt to rapidly changing markets whilst staying competitive in the satellite communication, navigation and Earth observation sectors. This requires the development of new competitive technologies for space and ground systems, such as very high throughput and flexible satellites, very high-resolution sensors, radiation-hardened electronics, on-board and ground Artificial Intelligence (AI), optical communication and quantum technologies, as well as advanced robotics. We also need to prepare the ground for future modular, flexible and intelligent satellites. In the mid to long term, the future space ecosystem should include hybrid, smart and reconfigurable satellites, which can be manufactured, assembled and serviced directly in-orbit, and with a de-orbiting capacity.</p><p>Digitalisation and automation will enable advanced design and manufacturing methods (including additive manufacturing) and \u201cDigital Twins\u201d, plug-and-play modularity, as well as model based system engineering. This will yield reductions in mass, cost, emission, energy consumption and development time.</p><p>Disruptive technologies and concepts should be further developed to bring breakthrough innovation to the space sector, while at the same time advancing technology maturation in the view of qualification on ground or via In-Orbit Demonstration and Validation activities.</p><p><strong><u>Reinforce EU capacity to access to space</u></strong></p><p>Two specific challenges stand out. Firstly, the highly competitive global market for launch services, which is characterised by an increasing number of competitors, secondly, the emerging opportunities in space transportation that have not been yet seized by European launch actors characterised by new uses of space (e.g. small satellites, larger constellations, payload recovery, payload quick deployment), new services (e.g. direct orbit injection, in-orbit servicing) and in-space transportation. This will require, amongst others, new concepts for reducing the production and operation cost such as reusability (including stage recovery and landing) of launcher and vehicle components, and low cost, high thrust and green propulsion, modular avionics, autonomous systems, micro launchers, re-entry vehicles and modern and flexible test and launch facilities. Both will require urgent activities to enable operational capacities by at the latest 2030.</p><p>Disruptive technologies, methodologies and concepts should be developed to bring breakthrough innovation to the launcher systems sector as well as to contribute to cost reduction and contribute to the preparation of a competitive European Space Transportation beyond 2030.</p><p><strong><u>Evolution of Space and ground infrastructures for Galileo/EGNOS</u></strong></p><p>For Galileo/EGNOS, the international context, the competitive environment with emerging actors and novel techniques in the value chain, the increasing threats, and the evolution of the technologies, components and systems, including dual-use technology, call for a constant adaptation of the EU space infrastructure to these changing realities.</p><p>To meet these challenges, EU needs sustained investments in R&amp;D for innovative mission concepts, technology and systems. These will ensure the continuity of the EGNSS service, minimise the risks for technology inclusion in the infrastructure, thanks to anticipated development and testing including in-orbit, protect better this infrastructure against modern threats (notably cyber, jamming/spoofing, natural hazards), and increase the strategic autonomy in key technologies. Overall, they will maintain the EU\u00b4s leadership position in the Global Navigation Satellite Systems.</p><p><strong><u>Evolution of services: Copernicus</u></strong></p><p>Copernicus core services (Climate, Marine environment, Land monitoring, Atmosphere monitoring, Emergency management and Security) must evolve and improve to better respond to new and emerging policy needs, such as anthropogenic CO2, green house gas and pollutant monitoring, climate change mitigation and adaptation, EU arctic policy, coastal area, sustainable development goals, environmental compliance, protection of natural resources, ecosystems and biodiversity, food security, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture, crisis management, safe transport, sustainable and clean energy, border management, preserving cultural heritage, as well as other new domains that could bring key contributions to the European Green Deal and to other EU priorities.</p><p>Similarly, the Galileo service portfolio (High precision positioning, navigation and timing, authentication, search and rescue and Public Regulated Service, PRS) must be adapted to the evolution of the user needs and market trends. This requires new services and capabilities to better serve the downstream application sector, so that EGNSS remains at the fore front of the provision of satellite positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) services and keeps the pace with increasing global competition in the sector (USA, China, 5G, etc.). Europe should extend Galileo services to various societal challenges and offer it as a complementary service to emerging markets like 5G, CCAM and AI.</p><p><strong><u>Development of applications for Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus</u></strong></p><p>EGNSS and Copernicus capacities are unique and world-class and should be fully utilised for EU citizens, companies and society. Research and innovation should therefore foster the development of EGNSS downstream applications and promote their adoption in the EU and worldwide, in particular in markets with a long lead-time (e.g. maritime, rail, aviation), and in areas where Galileo offers unique differentiators (high accuracy, authentication, Search and Rescue, PRS</p><p>Copernicus based applications and services can serve, for example, polar research, monitoring of the environment, maritime and coastal monitoring, natural disasters, civil security, migration and agriculture. They and can bring, with EGNSS, a key contribution to the European Green Deal and to the sustainable management of natural resources. The public sector should be supported as customer of space based technologies via innovation procurement. Synergies between Galileo/EGNOS and Copernicus, as well as synergies with non-space programmes, leveraging the combination of space data with non-space data, will open new avenues for the creation of a wealth of new and innovative applications and services. The use of Copernicus and Galileo/EGNOS for the EOSC and DestinE initiatives should equally be taken into account and promoted.</p><p><strong><u>Innovative space capabilities: SSA, GOVSATCOM, Quantum</u></strong></p><p>Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and GOVSATCOM innovative components will be developed in the EU Space programme fostered by Horizon Europe R&amp;I. Quantum Technologies, as an emerging field with great potential to be applied in the EU Space programme, requires foundational research and validation activities for its space component.</p><p><strong>Space Situational Awareness (SSA)</strong> will provide services to European users including spacecraft owners/operators and governmental entities that will reinforce the protection and resilience of European space and ground infrastructures against various hazards and risks (mainly collisions in/from space, Near Earth Objects or space weather events). New challenges are posed by the ever-increasing orbital population of smaller satellites and space debris and the associated increased risk of orbital collisions, fragmentations and re-entries. R&amp;I activities shall address these challenges by developing novel architectures and technical solutions for ground/space sensors, data processing, networking and operation centres (including critical technological elements for the realisation of crucial future space weather applications and services) to ensure safety and sustainability of space operations in Europe as well as by improving current EUSST services and implementing new ones (space debris mitigation and remediation services; space weather services).</p><p>The <strong>GOVSATCOM</strong> initiative aims to provide reliable, secured and cost-effective satellite communications services to EU and Member State authorities with an infrastructure supporting secure critical missions and the ability to exchange sensitive information in a environment of worldwide hybrid threats (including the Arctic). Research and innovation activities will foster the development of European satcom security related technologies and increase European independence from foreign critical technologies and exploiting synergies with Copernicus and Galileo and with defence /security assets.</p><p>Space will pave the way for <strong>quantum technologies</strong> in EU space infrastructure and for space-based services (e.g. quantum inter-satellite communication, next generation atomic clocks or quantum sensors). It is of the highest strategic importance for the EU and its industry to be competitive and to become a global leader in this area. It will provide enhanced services to EU citizens and allow overcoming limitations and challenges of the current generation of quantum technologies. Therefore, R&amp;I shall foster the development and use of EU sourced space qualified quantum components, including mission design, integration and in-orbit demonstration and validating. The availability of adequate ground segment infrastructure for testing and validating the quantum space mission needs to be ensured too. Synergies with GOVSATCOM will be thought.</p><p><strong><u>Space entrepreneurship ecosystems (incl. New Space and start-ups) and skills</u></strong></p><p>Business development, acceleration and upscaling of start-ups will be fostered across all space areas under the CASSINI Space Entrepreneurship Initiative.</p><p>CASSINI will provide support to business and innovation-friendly ecosystems, including the strengthening business skills in the space market segments and digital services based on space data. The objective is to make start-ups and scale-ups investment-ready and able to secure venture capital funding. Synergies with the InvestEU programme and the Space programme will be established.</p><p><strong><u>Targeted and strategic actions supporting the EU space sector</u></strong></p><p>Development of associated technologies and actions of key importance to the sections described above will be pursued. These actions will at the same time contribute to foster the competitiveness of the EU space sector, to reinforce our capacity to use and access space and to perform R&amp;I for the Space Programme.</p><p>These targeted and strategic actions will include the development of critical technologies for EU non-dependence, the establishment of regular and cost-effective flight opportunities for In-Orbit Demonstration/In-Orbit Validation (IOD/IOV), space science activities, as well as outreach, education and international cooperation activities.</p><p><u><strong>Limiting participation in certain actions to Member States (and certain candidate associated countries to Horizon Europe)</strong></u></p><p>The Space research part of the Horizon Europe Programme is by default open to the world, promoting international cooperation to drive scientific excellence.</p><p>However, an important aspect of the Space Programme consists in ensuring security and strengthening strategic autonomy across key technologies and value chains, taking advantage of the possibilities that space offers for the security of the Union and its Member States. This objective requires special rules in specific cases to set the requisite eligibility and participation conditions to ensure the protection of the integrity, security and resilience of the Union and its Member States. Hence, on an exceptional basis and duly justified, the work programme may foresee a limited participation to entities from selected countries. Such exceptional circumstances would relate to prevalent considerations to safeguard the Union\u2019s strategic assets, interests, autonomy or security. Possibilities for such limitations are framed by Article 22(5)and by Annex IV(11a) of the Horizon Europe Regulation. Out of 45 actions, 30 remain fully open while 15 are proposed for limited participation</p><p>For six space actions, the restrictions to only Member States are justified under Annex IV of the Horizon Europe Regulation which foresees that, where appropriate the eligibility criteria of the Space Programme Regulation shall apply for the Horizon Europe space research topics and actions. In the current work programme this includes SST and GOVSATCOM which relate to sensitive Union space infrastructure.</p><p>Nine space actions are open to Member States, Norway and Iceland under Protocol 31 of the EEA Agreement and the United Kingdom. These nine actions include Copernicus Security R&amp;D and actions involving technologies critical to strategic autonomy/dual-use.</p><p>The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to legal entities established in the EU, Norway, Iceland and the United Kingdom. The eligibility of entities established in the UK to participate is conditional upon reciprocity of access to equivalent UK programmes for entities established in Member States, which will be assessed by the Commission as soon as such programmes are established and in any event before the signature of the grant agreements. Should the UK not open the participation in its relevant programmes to entities established in Member States, this condition would not be met and entities established in the UK will not be eligible to participate in this topic.</p>", "destinationDescription": "Open strategic autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space-based infrastructures, services, applications and data", "topicMGAs": [], "keywords": ["Societal Engagement"], "flags": ["SocietalEngagement"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-CSA HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "02 November 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["16 February 2022"]}], "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Jun 30, 2022 3:38:43 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Jun 30, 2022 3:38:43 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">An overview of the HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01 evaluation results (Flash Call Info) is now available <a href=\"https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-06/HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01%20Flash%20call%20update.pdf \" target=\"_blank\">under the link</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Oct 29, 2021 1:03:42 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Oct 29, 2021 1:03:42 PM", "content": "<p>Following the adoption of the revised Horizon Work Programme on 28 October 2021, for technical reasons the planned opening date of the call has been postponed until 2 November 2021.</p>"}], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3404416": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL4-2022-SPACE-01-21 -
