Admissibility conditions:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour proposal must build on results (demonstrated proof of principle)  achieved within an eligible project. As Transition funding is a new  scheme, for 2021 it is restricted to applications based on results  generated by the following eligible projects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>EIC Pathfinder projects (including projects funded under EIC  pilot Pathfinder, Horizon 2020 FET-Open, FET-Proactive) and FET  Flagships calls (including ERANET calls under the FET work programme)</li>\r\n    <li>European Research Council (ERC) Proof of Concept projects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are applying on the basis of an eligible project for which the  grant is still active, you may apply if the project has been active for  at least 12 months (i.e. the start date of the grant is more than 12  months before the date of the Transition call deadline).</p>\r\n<p>If you are applying on the basis of an eligible project which has  already been completed, you may apply within 24 months of the completion  of the project (i.e. the end date of the grant for the eligible project  is less than 24 months from the date of the Transition call deadline).</p>\r\n<p>You do not need to be a participant, Principle Investigator or result  owner of the previous projects; on the contrary, new participants are  welcome and encouraged to apply. However, you must demonstrate that you  are the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) owner or holder, or have the  necessary rights to commercialise the IPR of the linked Pathfinder, FET  or ERC Proof of Concept project results to be further developed. You  therefore must specify in your application the result and relevant IP to  be developed, and include written evidence from the relevant owner(s)  of the result(s), which confirms the existence of the necessary  agreements with you, including on IPR.</p>\r\n<p>You can apply for EIC Transition either as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A single legal entity established in a Member State or an  Associated Country (&lsquo;mono-beneficiary&rsquo;) if you are an SME or a research  performing organisation (university, research or technology  organisation, including teams, individual Principle Investigators and  inventors in such institutions who intend to form a spinout company).
