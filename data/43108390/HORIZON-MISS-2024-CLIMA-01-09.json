Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[<sup> </sup><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf</a>]].</p><p>The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the <strong>Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, </strong>to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice \u2013 the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>", "missionDescription": "Mission: Adaptation to climate change (2023/24)", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["systemic", "local needs", "cross-sectors", "Mission on adaptation to climate change", "demonstration", "climate resilience"], "keywords": ["Climatology and climate change", "Environment, Pollution & Climate", "Sustainable development and climate action"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094502, "abbreviation": "Open", "description": "Open"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "24 April 2024", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["18 September 2024"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3523386": [{"action": "HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-04 -

Effectively adapting to climate change relies on cross-sectoral approaches, looking at the system as a whole, and on the inclusion of a variety of actors.</p><p>Proposals should integrate multi-faceted technological, digital, business, governance and environmental aspects with social innovation into the development of solutions contributing to increase preparedness to changing climate for specific regions, cities or local communities. For example, they should assess and identify management solutions that best minimise and compensate the loss of ecosystem services (e.g., water cycling and cooling that were previously provided by soil and trees) while improving climate preparedness. The proposed solution should address climate risk identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics, local governance and the regional sustainable and smart specialization strategies when available.</p><p>In its approach, the proposed solution should go 'far beyond addressing a specific sector', taking into account and addressing wide-ranging impacts. It should take a systemic approach, looking at the interconnections and interdependencies between them. For example, proposals could explore solutions addressing the interlinkages between climate, water, food, soil, biodiversity loss and others, which form a nexus where resource use and availability rely heavily on one another. Considering the current increasing trend of water scarcity (periods of drought followed by storms and floods, with a decreasing overall annual precipitations) tackling the pollution problem linked to these extreme climate events would be relevant. Another example of systemic approach can relate to the integration of multilevel planning, which integrates spatial and urban planning with the design of different services such as transport, mobility, energy, connectivity in a city. Interesting examples in this sense may come for instance from the New European Bauhaus initiative, which intends to accelerate the green transition by combining sustainability with inclusion and aesthetics/quality of experience.</p><p>Interconnections and interdependencies need to be well understood and are further complicated as amplitude of climate change in the future is uncertain. In the medium and long term, for example, we know that climate change will affect water availability and crop yields with wide-ranging implications and that certain adaptation options (such as broader use of desalination for provision of drinking water to cope with water scarcity) can be energy intensive which compounds the problem of global warming, have local impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems, have side-effects that impact the environment (as is the case of brine from desalination, or water abstractions to produce hydrogen). Furthermore, it is not known to which level those adaption options could be implemented locally based on the relevance of the expected impacts or would be bashed away.</p><p>Proposals should look to how tackle and possibly minimise trade-offs, maximise co-benefits and leverage opportunities a systemic approach offers to address the challenges of a changing climate in the specific local context. In doing this, they should produce state-of-the-art- analysis in a multidisciplinary approach addressing the science-policy nexus; they should go beyond theoretical research and/or theoretical discussions or the pure understanding and quantifying of the links between the different elements and sectors. On the contrary, proposals should turn them into operational and practical insights and tangible solutions experimented on the regional and local grounds, clearly addressing trade-offs and co-benefits, with a view of achieving optimum outcomes. Proposals should also consider how to turn the proposed solutions into new standards so to allow faster uptake at scale.</p><p>In addition, proposals should mobilise and include all value chain actors and pay careful attention to matching innovators and solutions providers with end-users/regions interested in testing and further developing the proposed solutions on the ground; they should also foster the development of business models that can support the sustainability of the proposed solutions.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three \u201creplicating\u201d regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the \u201creplicating\u201d regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare in the course of the project the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds or the Just Transition Fund.</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> and Climate-ADAPT<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> (. Proposals should also explore synergies with the projects funded under the topic \u201cHORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-04: Research the complex interplay between the climate and biodiversity crises towards more systemic approaches and solutions\u201d of this call.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.</p><p>In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.</p><p>Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Specific Topic Conditions</SPAN>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 to 7 by the end of the project \u2013 see General Annex B. </p></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a>Currently managed by MIP4Adapt under the contract CINEA/2022/OP/0013/SI2.884597 funded by the European Union. <a href=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/the-mission/about-mip4adapt\">About MIP4Adapt (europa.eu)</a></p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>The European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT is a partnership between the DG Climate Action and the <a href=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/\">European Environment Agency.</a>https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/</p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%;\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
