This often results in the deployment of conflicting solutions and interventions, with wasteful use of investments and resources. However, the transition to climate neutrality will require significant reductions in GHG emissions across a range of sectors such as urban mobility, energy efficiency in buildings, water and waste management as well as the (re)design, adaption or retrofitting of urban spaces/cities, building stock and </span>infrastructures along with the development of more efficient management strategies based on sensor data and novel analysis methods. Retrofitting of buildings is an opportunity to, simultaneously and in a cost-efficient way, improve aspects related to health, safety, accessibility and overall quality of life.</p><p><span>The overall aim of this topic is to support a diverse range of urban areas across Europe (e.g. small and medium sized, port cities, cities with different geographical, climatic, socioeconomic conditions, levels of preparedness etc.), their urban authorities, stakeholders and citizens to identify, plan, design, fund, roll out and replicate solutions and measures in order to achieve climate neutrality, sustainability and resilience and significantly reduce emissions across the most relevant sectors by 2030.</span></p><p><span>Long-term integrated, visionary, people-centric urban planning and design practices are needed to enable the transition toward just, sustainable, resilient and climate neutral cities. This requires the setup of new collaborative frameworks, novel inter-institutional settings and innovative services and tools harnessing local citizen knowledge, social innovation, new technologies and digitalisation to ensure cross-sectorial (e.g. infrastructures, transport, energy, water, built environment and natural environment) interventions, full engagement and informed participation of citizens and communities and trigger necessary behavioural and lifestyles changes.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should set up innovative urban planning and design practices that result in flexile building/design regulations and instruments, that harmonize </span>high quality place making, <span>mix-land use, compact urban fabrics and well-balanced densities with equitable access to amenities.</span></p><p>The new urban planning and design practices and tools should aim at climate neutrality and a significant reduction in emissions by 2030. They should also aim to respect the urban form and typology, its aesthetics, character and identity while facilitating circularity and the use of innovative and clean building technologies, materials and construction techniques, in line with the guiding principles of the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative. The resulting practices and tools should seek to maximize the economic, social, environmental and health benefits for all groups and communities, including groups that are vulnerable to exclusion, while averting spatial segregation, urban sprawl, gentrification and real estate speculation and increasing resilience to climate related hazards.</p><p><span>Proposals should use as necessary existing or improved </span>state-of-the-art tools and methods for visualising, modelling, predicting, stimulating and analysing scenarios, assessing feasibility and cost-effectiveness of solutions, integrating existing and emerging data and tools, including under relevant EU laws and initiatives (e.g. air quality plans, Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans, local digital twins etc.).

The selected projects should also foresee active collaboration with relevant and related projects funded under this call in order to address synergies and complementarities between the projects of the Cities Mission portfolio. In particular collaboration with the Mission Platform (</span>HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the workplan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined at a second stage during the lifetime of the projects. The collaboration with the Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects starting date<span>. </span></p><p><span>Inter- and trans-disciplinary consortia combining expertise and capacity from public authorities, urban stakeholders, infrastructure providers, knowledge institutions, planners, cultural and creative organizations, entrepreneurs, societal actors and citizens are necessary to address the challenges of this topic.
