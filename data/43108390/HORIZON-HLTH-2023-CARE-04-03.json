Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019, </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em> and <em>\u2018A Competitive and secure data economy</em>\u2019.</p><p>Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.</p><p>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens\u2019 health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised medicine</li><li>Increasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discrimination</li><li>Improving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce, including informal carers</li><li>Enhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the European Green Deal.</li> </ul><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 <em>\u201cCulture, Creativity and Inclusive Society</em>\u201d such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil Security for Society\u201d</em> such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation); with cluster 5 \u201c<em>Climate, Energy and Mobility\u201d; </em>and cluster 6<em> \u201cFood, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment\u201d</em>.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Policy and decision makers, providers of health and care, health and care workers and citizens have increased knowledge on how today\u2019s health and care systems<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> are not environmentally sustainable, what the possible costs of that are (today and future) and where improvements are possible with maintained or improved quality of care (optimal patient safety not being jeopardised) and possible investments needed.</li><li>Policy and decision makers and providers of health and care services have access to innovative solutions, organisational models (including financing models), and guidelines and recommendations that reduce the pollution and carbon emissions stemming from health and care systems, so that health and care provision can become more sustainable and cost-effective while maintaining or improving quality of care thanks to the reduction of energy and materials use, decreased carbon emissions, reduced waste and discharges, and efficient resource management.</li><li>Monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions and pollution is mainstreamed through a life-cycle approach and with standard methods in the health and care systems. </li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>The health care sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>, and generates significant demands for energy and materials, as well as dangerous waste streams that may cause air, soil and water pollution. At the same time, health and care provision generally experiences less pressure to decarbonise and improve its circularity than other sectors of the economy. With the European Green Deal, the EU commits to reducing net greenhouse gas emission by at least 55% by 2030, and to reach no net emissions by 2050, and the health and care systems are not exempt. Research and innovation can support by ensuring a smooth transformation while maintaining or improving quality of health and care services.</p><p>Health and care systems are undergoing structural changes, for example by strengthening primary care and community-based care, strengthening digitalisation and making sure patients are treated or cared for at the most efficient level. This offers the possibility to connect structural changes with an environmental transformation.</p><p>During COP26, 18 countries (including two EU Member States) have committed to cutting all carbon emissions from their health systems over the next 10 to 30 years and during the same period in total fifty countries (including six EU Member States) have committed to creating climate resilient, low carbon, sustainable health systems.</p><p>In February 2022, the WHO published a report on the waste that had been generated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even more emphasising the need to improve waste management systems of the health and care systems<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>. The report states that 30% of healthcare facilities word-wide, and 60% in the least developed countries, are not fit to handle the waste generated even when not taking the extra waste generated by the pandemic into account. Not only does this pose environmental risks such as water and air pollution, but it also poses a risk to health workers\u2019 safety by increasing the risk of being exposed to stick injuries, burns and pathogenic microorganisms.</p><p>Research and innovation activities under this topic should be specific to health and care sectors. They should include cost studies when relevant (environmental impacts and benefits to be quantified through the life cycle thinking approach (e.g. LCA/SLCA), to be effectively implemented in line with the European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Action Plan) and piloting research results onsite in hospitals or other care settings while generating accessible knowledge could be included. Apart from that, successful proposals should address several of the following:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation of hospitals and other care providers: improvements in new and existing building stock, decarbonisation of energy supply to premises, reduction in energy demand of hospital sites and other care facilities (for example heating and cooling, hot water, laundry, cooking, transport systems).</li><li>Research and innovative solutions for increased circularity of hospitals or other care providers that integrate the zero-pollution ambition: such as solutions to reduce waste, improved waste management practices (with a possible focus on water effluents and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)), increased circularity (for example sustainable use of linen).</li><li>Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation and greening of supply chains and material inflows: reduction of single-use plastics, substitution of anaesthetic gases and inhalers with high global warming potentials (GWPs), substitution of conventional pharmaceuticals with green(er) alternatives, low-carbon supply chains of food, waste reduction, management models on for example prescription of pharmaceuticals.</li><li>Development of a framework to measure and benchmark the environmental footprint of the health and care sectors or improving infrastructures for relevant collecting, sharing, accessing and processing of data.</li> </ul><p>Projects with interdisciplinary teams representing the health and care sectors, and the environmental sector or other relevant sectors are welcome.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Applicants are encouraged to consider how their proposals can contribute in the context of the European Green Deal<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>, and to take into account the principles of the Circular Economy Action Plan<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup>, the Zero Pollution Action Plan<sup><a target=_self href=#fn6 id=r6>[6]</a></sup> as well as the Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.
