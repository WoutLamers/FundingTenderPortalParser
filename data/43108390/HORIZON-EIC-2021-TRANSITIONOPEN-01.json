The EIC Transition Open is twofold, supporting both the maturation and validation of a novel technology, and the development of a business case and business model towards the innovation\u2019s future commercialisation. </span></p><p><span>EIC Transition projects should address both technology and market/business dimensions where iterative learning processes based on early customer feedback is possible. These activities should include a suitable mix of research, technology development and validation activities to increase the maturity of the technology beyond proof of principle to viable demonstrators of the technology in the intended field of application (i.e. up to Technology Readiness Level 5 to 6) in the attempt to address market readiness towards commercialisation and deployment, as well as other aspects of regulation, certification and standardisation, aimed at getting both the technology and the business idea investment-ready.</span></p><p><span>The objectives of the EIC Transition are to mature both the technology and business idea to increase the project\u2019s technology and its market readiness. By doing this, the EIC Transition offers its applicants a solid support to deliver on the market a technology that is effective for its intended application, as well as a successful business model and business plan for its development to the market. </span></p><p><span>The EIC Transition provides a total indicative budget of EUR 59.6 million. The EIC considers proposal with a requested EU contribution of up to a EUR 2.5 million as appropriate. Requesting larger amount is possible if properly justified. </span></p><p><span>Call deadline for submitting proposals is 22 September 2021 at 17h00 Brussels local time.

Admissibility conditions:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour proposal must build on results (demonstrated proof of principle) achieved within an eligible project. As Transition funding is a new scheme, for 2021 it is restricted to applications based on results generated by the following eligible projects:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>EIC Pathfinder projects (including projects funded under EIC pilot Pathfinder, Horizon 2020 FET-Open, FET-Proactive) and FET Flagships calls (including ERANET calls under the FET work programme)</li>\r\n    <li>European Research Council (ERC) Proof of Concept projects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you are applying on the basis of an eligible project for which the grant is still active, you may apply if the project has been active for at least 12 months (i.e. the start date of the grant is more than 12 months before the date of the Transition call deadline).</p>\r\n<p>If you are applying on the basis of an eligible project which has already been completed, you may apply within 24 months of the completion of the project (i.e. the end date of the grant for the eligible project is less than 24 months from the date of the Transition call deadline).</p>\r\n<p>You do not need to be a participant, Principle Investigator or result owner of the previous projects; on the contrary, new participants are welcome and encouraged to apply. However, you must demonstrate that you are the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) owner or holder, or have the necessary rights to commercialise the IPR of the linked Pathfinder, FET or ERC Proof of Concept project results to be further developed. You therefore must specify in your application the result and relevant IP to be developed, and include written evidence from the relevant owner(s) of the result(s), which confirms the existence of the necessary agreements with you, including on IPR.</p>\r\n<p>You can apply for EIC Transition either as:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A single legal entity established in a Member State or an Associated Country (&lsquo;mono-beneficiary&rsquo;) if you are an SME or a research performing organisation (university, research or technology organisation, including teams, individual Principle Investigators and inventors in such institutions who intend to form a spinout company). Larger companies (i.e. which do not qualify as SMEs) are not eligible to apply as a single legal entity; or</li>\r\n    <li>A small consortium of minimum two and maximum five independent legal entities (&lsquo;multi-beneficiary&rsquo;) that may for example include universities, research organisations, SMEs or larger companies, user/customer organisations or potential end users (e.g. hospitals, utilities, industry, regulatory and standardisation bodies, public authorities).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your proposal will only be evaluated if it is admissible and eligible (see Annex 2 as well as Annex 3 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2021/wp_horizon-eic-2021_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">EIC&nbsp;Work Programme 2021</a> for eligibility of third country applicants).</p>\n<p><strong>  Proposal page limits and layout:</strong> Sections 1 to 3 of your proposal must consist of a maximum of 25 A4 pages.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2.
