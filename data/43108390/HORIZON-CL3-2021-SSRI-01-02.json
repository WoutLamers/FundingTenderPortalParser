Since then, the programme has contributed substantially to knowledge and value creation in the field of internal security and to the consolidation of an ecosystem better equipped to capitalise on research and innovation to support the EU security priorities.</p><p>While the success of the programme has materialised in relevant scientific findings, maturation of promising technology areas, operational validation of innovative concepts or support to policy implementation, a key challenge remains in improving the uptake of innovation.</p><p>The extent to which innovative technologies developed thanks to EU R&amp;I investment are industrialised and commercialised by EU industry, and later acquired and deployed by end-users, thus contributing to the development of security capabilities[[For the purpose of this work programme, the terms \u201cCapability\u201d should be understood as \"the ability to pursue a particular policy priority or achieve a desired operational effect\u201d. The term \u201ccapability\u201d is often interchanged with the term \u201ccapacity\u201d, but this should be avoided. \u201cCapacity\u201d could refer to an amount or volume of which one organisation could have enough or not. On the other hand, \u201ccapability\u201d refers to an ability, an aptitude or a process that can be developed or improved in consonance with the ultimate objective of the organisation.]], could give a valuable measure of the impact achieved with the programme. However, there are factors inherent to the EU security ecosystem (often attributed to the market) that hinder the full achievement of this impact. These include market fragmentation, cultural barriers, analytical weaknesses, programming weaknesses, ethical, legal and societal considerations or lack of synergies between funding instruments, among others.</p><p>It is worth noting that such factors affect all the security domains addressed in Cluster 3; that there is not one predominant factor with sufficient leverage by itself to change the overall innovation uptake dynamics; and that they exhibit complex relationships among them which are difficult to disentangle. It should also be noted that the innovation uptake process starts before the R&amp;I cycle is triggered, and it is not finalised with the successful termination of a research project. Therefore, the uptake challenge extends beyond the realm of R&amp;I. However, from within R&amp;I it is possible, if not to materialise the uptake in every case, at least to pave the way towards its materialisation.</p><p>To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&amp;I, that is visible and recognisable to those interested in contributing to this aim, and which provides bespoke tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake.</p><p>The SSRI Destination has therefore been designed with this purpose to serve equally to all the expected impacts of Cluster 3. Research applied in this domain will contribute to increasing the impact of the work carried out in the EU security Research and Innovation ecosystem as a whole and to contribute to its core values, namely: i) Ensuring that security R&amp;I maintains the focus on the potential final use of its outcomes; ii) Contributing to a forward-looking planning of EU security capabilities; iii) Ensuring the development of security technologies that are socially acceptable; iv) Paving the way to the industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and deployment of successful R&amp;I outcomes; and v) Safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>While the other Destinations of this Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme offer research and innovation activities to develop solutions to address specific security threats or capability needs, the SSRI Destination will contribute with instruments that will help bringing these and other developments closer to the market. Such instruments will help developers (including industry, research organisations and academia) to improve the valorisation of their research investment. They will also support buyers and users in materialising the uptake of innovation and further develop their security capabilities.</p><p>In addition, the SSRI Destination will offer an open environment to create knowledge and value through research in matters (including technology, but also social sciences and humanities) that are not exclusive of only one security area, but cross-cutting to the whole Cluster. This will contribute to reducing thematic fragmentation, bringing closer together the actors from different security domains, and expanding the market beyond traditional thematic silos.</p><p>Finally, SSRI will allow the allocation of resources to the development of tools and methods to reinforce the innovation cycle itself from a process standpoint, thus increasing its effectiveness, efficiency and impact. This Destination will contribute to the development of an analytical capacity tailored to the specific needs of security stakeholders for the materialisation of a structured long-term capability based planning of research and innovation for security.</p><p>In order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following impacts:</p><ul><li>A more effective and efficient evidence-based development of EU civil security capabilities built on a stronger, more systematic and analysis-intensive security research and innovation cycle;</li><li>Increased industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of successful outcomes of security research reinforces the competitiveness and resilience of EU security technology and industrial base and safeguards the security of supply of EU-products in critical security areas;</li><li>R&amp;I-enabled knowledge and value in cross-cutting matters reduces sector specific bias and breaks thematic silos that impede the proliferation of common security solutions.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Strengthened Security Research and Innovation", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["security knowledge", "civil protection", "critical infrastructure protection", "Border Security", "uptake", "Resilient Infrastructure", "border management", "knowledge networks", "research programming", "innovation uptake", "security networks"], "keywords": ["Technology evaluation", "Research to business", "Competitiveness, innovation, research and developm", "Innovation", "Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)", "Certification, Verification, Validation, Technical", "Secure Societies", "Border and external security", "Other effectiveness and performance studies", "Societal impact", "Civil security", "Using results for policy development (streaming)", "Evaluation of results", "Quantitative analysis", "Security", "Knowledge management", "Standardisation", "End-users", "Innovation management", "Policy impact", "Economic impact", "Knowledge and Technology transfer", "Impact Assessment", "Information exchange", "Border surveillance", "Horizontal issues", "Social sciences and humanities", "Exploitation of results", "Knowledge transfer", "Market analysis", "Optimisation, Planning & Decision Support systems"], "flags": ["SSH"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-CSA HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "30 June 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["23 November 2021"]}], "latestInfos": [], "budgetOverviewJSONItem": {"budgetTopicActionMap": {"3329507": [{"action": "HORIZON-CL3-2021-SSRI-01-05 -

The innovation uptake process begins with the identification of a need and ends with an innovative solution deployed on the field of operations, being R&amp;I only one of the many contributors to the overall process, but not the first and not the last. In other words, successful results of research projects are a necessary but not sufficient condition to guarantee the uptake of innovation.</span></p><p><span>Investment in security research needs to be designed taking into consideration how and when it can deliver outcomes that contribute to the development of security capabilities. Therefore, research will </span>be undertaken, from its very early stages, in a way that addresses real needs while guaranteeing the impact in the final solutions. It will also ensure to identify and underpin the factors that could help in the implementation of its results. However, the programming of research is highly conditioned by the quality, reliability and timeliness of the evidence that supports its decision making process. This includes the identification and understanding of the contextual elements that can or will influence or be influenced by the research (process), the research team and the research projects themselves.</p><p><span>The European Commission and the EU Member States carry out this programming exercise periodically, taking into account a wide variety of inputs. </span><span><span><span>The complexity of the challenge is notable, considering that the EU security landscape is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous in what regards the security threats, the capabilities required to face them, the evolution of modern technolo</span></span></span>gies, and the skillset needed to deploy those. In order to carry out a sound programming exercise, the European Commission and the EU Member States strive to consult and involve all actors. With that aim, experts are gathered in different configurations and their inputs are coordinated at EU and national levels to be factored in by the decision-making bodie<span><span><span>s of EU-funded security research.</span></span></span></p><p><span>These experts require high quality, reliable and timely evidence to support their assessments, but information is often scattered, hardly visible and requires bespoke processing for the detection of patterns and for the generation of actionable intelligence. In other cases, it is simply not presented in the right format to unveil its value.</span></p><p><span>Applicants are invited to submit proposals for the establishment of Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp; Innovation. The role of these networks is to collect, aggregate, process, disseminate and exploit the existing knowledge to directly contribute to the expected outcomes of this topic.</span></p><p><span>Networks should engage with the main sources of information in order to have a sound and updated picture of the aspects mentioned above. This includes interaction with security experts (beyond the members of the project consortium), organisations, projects or initiatives, but also an extensive review of available databases, studies, reports or literature (notably all information generated under the EU-funded security research programmes, and possibly under other EU or MS funding programmes).</span></p><p><span>The networks must ensure the dissemination and exploitation of their findings to the different communities of the security research ecosystem, including policy makers, security authorities, industry, researchers and citizens. </span><span><span><span>Special emphasis needs to be mad</span></span></span>e on the contribution of these networks to the work of entities and initiatives established by the European Commission (e.g. Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network) and the EU Agencies to contribute to the security research programming effort In this regard, the networks should contribute timely and intensively to the work of the Thematic Working Groups of the Community of Users for Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies <span>(future CERIS \u2013Community of European Research and Innovation for Security)</span> and of other equivalent innovation labs/groups set-up by EU Agencies (e.g. Frontex). The networks have to contribute to these working groups with the quantitative and qualitative evidence required to carry out their activities in support to a more impactful EU-funded Security R&amp;I and to a more frequent and systematic innovation uptake.</p><p><span>Each proposal should include a plan, and a budget amounting at least 25% of the total cost of the action to carry out activities involving industry, academia and other providers of innovative solutions outside the consortium, for example with the aim to assessing the soundness of their findings, give support in validation processes, promote competitive development (e.g. via prizes) or dissemination of results, among other options.</span></p><p><span>The networks must </span><span>be in a position to deliver findings on the abovementioned challenges starting from the month 6 of the project and periodically every 6 months or less, in accordance with the information needs of the entities and initiatives they are contributing to.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should clearly describe the process and timing for the collection of inputs and the generation of outcomes.
