Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019, </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies\u2019</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em> and <em>\u2018A Competitive and secure data economy</em>\u2019.</p><p>Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.</p><p>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens\u2019 health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised medicine</li><li>Increasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discrimination</li><li>Improving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce, including informal carers</li><li>Enhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the European Green Deal.</li> </ul><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 <em>\u201cCulture, Creativity and Inclusive Society</em>\u201d such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil Security for Society\u201d</em> such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation); with cluster 5 \u201c<em>Climate, Energy and Mobility\u201d; </em>and cluster 6<em> \u201cFood, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment\u201d</em>.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public health needs, while patient safety and quality of services are increased.</li><li>Health care providers are trained and equipped with the skills and competences suited for the future needs of health care systems that are modernised, digitally transformed and equipped with innovative tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care. They save time and resources by integrating and applying innovative technologies, which better involve patients in their own care, by reorganising workflows and redistributing tasks and responsibilities throughout the health care system, and by monitoring and analysing corresponding health care activities.</li><li>Citizens are supported to play a key role in managing their own health care, informal carers (including unpaid carers) are fully supported (e.g. by preventing overburdening and economic stress) and specific needs of more vulnerable groups are recognised and addressed. They benefit from improved access to health care services, including financial risk protection, timely access to quality essential health care services, including safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines.</li><li>Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities, organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making.</li> </ul><p>The actions resulting from the calls under this destination will also create strong opportunities for synergies with the EU4Health programme and in particular to contribute to the goals under the general objective \u201cprotecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and specific objective 4 \u201cto strengthen health systems, their resilience and resource efficiency\u201d.</p>", "destinationDescription": "Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality

are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4, notably \u201cEnsuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality healthcare\u201d. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>European countries and regions, along with international partners, are engaged in enhanced collaborative research efforts for the development of innovative personalised medicine approaches regarding prevention, diagnosis and treatment;</li><li>Healthcare authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders develop evidence-based strategies and policies for the uptake of personalised medicine in national or regional healthcare systems;</li><li>Health industries, policymakers and other stakeholders have access to efficient measures and investments to allow swift transfer of research and innovation into market;</li><li>Health industries and other stakeholders can accelerate the uptake of personalised medicine through the adoption of innovative business models;</li><li>Healthcare authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use improved knowledge and understanding of the health and costs benefits of personalised medicine to optimise healthcare and make healthcare systems more sustainable;</li><li>Healthcare providers and professionals improve health outcomes, prevent diseases and maintain population health through the implementation of personalised medicine;</li><li>Stronger and highly connected local/regional ecosystems of stakeholders, including innovators, are in place and facilitate the uptake of successful innovations in personalised medicine, thus improving healthcare outcomes and strengthening European competitiveness;</li><li>Citizens, patients and healthcare professionals have a better knowledge of personalised medicine and are better involved in its implementation;</li><li>Stakeholders cooperate better and establish a network of national and regional knowledge hubs for personalised medicine.</li> </ul>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Personalised medicine is a medical model using characterisation of individuals' phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging and lifestyle data) for tailoring the right health strategy. Personalised medicine shows great promise and has already led to ground-breaking developments in treatment of many diseases. Through this approach, better health outcomes can be achieved by preventing disease and providing patient-centred care tailored to the needs of citizens. There have been important investments in personalised medicine over the last decades. However, producing knowledge, translating it into clinical applications and accelerating innovation uptake are complex, time-consuming and involve multiple stakeholders. There is a need to facilitate the uptake of health technology innovations and ensure a rapid and effective implementation of personalised medicine on a larger scale in Europe. To this end, the creation of a research and innovation (R&amp;I) partnership with a focus on personalised medicine represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate R&amp;I actions and leverage the efforts to accelerate the evolution of healthcare toward personalised medicine.</p><p>The partnership should build on knowledge gained from supportive initiatives like the International Consortium of Personalised Medicine (ICPerMed), the European Research Area Network for Personalised Medicine (ERA-PerMed), several Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs) funded by the EC under Horizon 2020, the one million genomes initiative as well as with an increasing number of associated and related initiatives, research infrastructures and capacities in Europe and beyond.</p><p>The partnership should facilitate exchange of information and good practices among countries, provide robust guidance and tools, will network institutional stakeholders and involve regional ecosystems. It should stimulate service, policy and organisational innovations, as well as the integration of biomedical and technological innovations for the benefit of the European citizens and the European industry. The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future personalised medicine. Through the objectives of Horizon Europe, the partnership should contribute to achieving the following European Commission priorities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Promoting our European way of life</li><li>An economy that works for people</li><li>A Europe fit for the digital age</li><li>A European green deal</li> </ul><p>The partnership will also contribute to priorities of the <em>\u201cCommunication on effective, accessible and resilient health systems\u201d</em> (COM(2014) 215 final), the <em>\u201cCommunication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens and building a healthier society\u201d</em> (COM(2018) 233 final) and the Europe's Beating Cancer Plan.</p><p>Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policymakers), to create a critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), the partnership should address the following objectives:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Putting Europe at the forefront of research and innovation through the support of multidisciplinary actions open to international cooperation;</li><li>Establishing a European national and regional network of research and innovation systems dedicated to personalised medicine;</li><li>Translating basic research into clinical applications that make a difference for patients, their families and healthcare professionals;</li><li>Filling scientific knowledge gaps, producing evidence and developing guidance and tools in priority areas for the development and the deployment of personalised medicine;</li><li>Integrating big data and digital health solutions in research and personalised healthcare;</li><li>Strengthening the European healthcare industry and accelerating the uptake of personalised medicine solutions;</li><li>Developing appropriate ecosystems for the implementation of successful personalised medicine approaches and a swift uptake of relevant innovations by healthcare systems;</li><li>Providing socio-economic evidence of the feasibility of personalised medicine approaches for its uptake by sustainable healthcare systems;</li><li>Improving health outcomes for citizen and patients and ensuring a wide access to advanced personalised medicine intervention approaches to all.</li> </ul><p>The European Partnership for Personalised Medicine<sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup> is to be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along the following main building blocks:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Joint implementation of the SRIA;</li><li>Joint annual calls for R&amp;I activities, applied R&amp;I, pilots;</li><li>Capacity building activities;</li><li>Activities to enhance the skills of the relevant personalised medicine workforce, and improve citizen relevant awareness and literacy;</li><li>Deployment activities through pilots, innovation procurement and financial support mechanisms,</li><li>Flanking measures.</li> </ul><p>The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wanting to join. It should include the following actors:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Ministries in charge of R&amp;I policy, as well as national and regional R&amp;I and technology funding agencies and foundations;</li><li>Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional healthcare authorities, organisations and providers.</li> </ul><p>The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and will involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation community, innovation owners, healthcare systems owners/organisers and healthcare agencies.</p><p>The Partnership\u2019s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should leave sufficient space for involving the key stakeholders, including but not limited to R&amp;I community, patients and citizens, healthcare professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.</p><p>Financial commitments and in-kind contributions are expected to be provided for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination.</p><p>To encourage national coordination and avoid an excess of grant signatories it is recommended to limit their number to two per country. However, in duly justified cases this number could differ, including for countries with decentralised administration to allow for participation of regional authorities in charge of R&amp;I policy and health and care policy.</p><p>To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other European partnerships and missions as set out in the working document on \u2018Coherence and Synergies of candidate European Partnerships under Horizon Europe\u2019<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup> as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, DEP, ESF+, ERDF<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup>, InvestEU, RRF and TSI.</p><p>The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup>.</p><p>Cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts should be considered. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.</p><p>Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.</p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><sup> </sup>More information on the planned European Partnerships is available on the Horizon Europe Webpage.</p><p id=fn2><a  target=_self href=#r2>[2]</a>Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, A4 Partnership Sector, October 2020: <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ec_rtd_coherence-synergies-of-ep-under-he_annex.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ec_rtd_coherence-synergies-of-ep-under-he_annex.pdf</a></p><p id=fn3><a  target=_self href=#r3>[3]</a>\u201cSynergies between Horizon Europe and ERDF programmes (Draft Commission Notice)\u201d <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/synergies-guidance-out-2022-07-06_en\">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/synergies-guidance-out-2022-07-06_en</a></p><p id=fn4><a  target=_self href=#r4>[4]</a>See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p>", "conditions": "<h1><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span style=\"line-height: 115%;\" lang=\"EN-US\">General conditions</span></b></span></span></span></h1>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.
