Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area \u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019 and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018living and working environments are health-promoting and sustainable thanks to better understanding of environmental, occupational, social and economic determinants of health\u2019. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: \u2018Good health and high-quality accessible health care\u2019, \u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019, and \u2018Clean and healthy air, water and soil\u2019. The environment we live and work in is a major determinant of our health and well-being. Environmental factors are estimated to account for almost 20% of all deaths in Europe. The impacting factors on both physical and mental health and wellbeing are not all identified nor their effects comprehensively understood and accounted for to support evidence-based policy- and decision-making. Therefore, Destination 2 aims at filling knowledge gaps in the understanding of the impacts on our health and well-being of those environmental, occupational and socio-economic risk factors that have the most significant or widespread societal impacts. In this work programme, Destination 2 focuses on pollution, disrupting chemicals, environmental degradation, climate and other environmental exposures in living and working environments. The results will support the EU\u2019s environment and health policies and overarching policy frameworks such as the European Green Deal, the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability, the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, the 8th Environment Action Programme, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work as well as the WHO European Environment and Health Process (EHP). Strong collaborations across sectors and with other Horizon Europe clusters dealing with issues such as agriculture, food, environment, climate, biodiversity, mobility, security, urban planning, social inclusion and gender will be needed to ensure that maximal societal benefits are reached. Thus, in view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. All topics are open to international collaboration to address global environment and health challenges.</p><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to living and working in a health-promoting environment, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Policymakers and regulators are aware and well informed about environmental, socio-economic and occupational risk factors as well as health-promoting factors across society;</li><li>Environmental, occupational, social, economic, fiscal and health policies and practices at the EU, national and regional level are sustainable and based on solid scientific evidence.

These changes have varying impacts on the working conditions, income and health and occupational safety both for skilled and unskilled workers. Furthermore, they contribute to the high costs of work-related illnesses and accidents for employers and the European economy in general.</p><p>Mental health and ergonomic-related problems affect a significant number of EU workers. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most common work-related health problems in the EU and workers and managers commonly identify stress, depression and anxiety as serious psychosocial outcomes of workplace exposures. Changes in the organisation of work can bring flexibility that allows more people to enter the labour force, but may also lead to psychosocial problems (for example, insecurity, compromised privacy and rest time, inadequate OSH and social protection, as well as stress due to excessive or atypical working hours, performance monitoring by algorithms and similar AI applications).</p><p>Some workplaces have either become exclusively virtual or they have evolved into a \u2018hybrid\u2019 model (e.g. multilocational working, home office), some work tasks and processes performed virtually and others requiring physical presence<sup><a target=_self href=#fn2 id=r2>[2]</a></sup>. A significant number of jobs are performed at clients\u2019 premises or require workers to commute long distances and/or cross borders regularly. Such workers are facing additional legal, social, environmental and economic issues. Data on how these affect their mental/physical health and well-being is scarce.</p><p>The emergence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change, causing, in some cases, additional challenges for workers\u2019 mental health (differentially affecting certain segments of the working force) and intensifying already existing physical risk factors (e.g. ergonomic risks). The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan<sup><a target=_self href=#fn3 id=r3>[3]</a></sup> aims to promote a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment in the EU and relies on Horizon Europe for research and innovation supporting economic and social resilience and sustainability. The EU strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-2027<sup><a target=_self href=#fn4 id=r4>[4]</a></sup> recognises the needs, challenges and opportunities that technological innovation<strong> </strong>and the pandemic bring for the working population and calls for strengthening the evidence-base for policymaking and implementation.</p><p>To address the issues described above, research actions under this topic should include several of the following activities:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Provide adequate and robust data on the impact (positive and negative) that the ongoing changes in the workplace are having on the mental and physical health of different categories of workers and working sectors (e.g. teleworkers, cross-border commuters, gig economy workers, and vulnerable groups such as women, migrants and young and older workers with increased demonstrated risk for MSDs), including gender and intersectional analyses, where appropriate;</li><li>Generate evidence (including data) not only on mental health, but also on mental well-being at the workplace and how changing work organisation due to the twin transitions and the pandemic affects workers\u2019 work-life balance and work ability;</li><li>Generate evidence (including data) on the importance of risk factors (such as stress caused by new working environments, static postures and physical inactivity, physically strenuous and highly repetitive work arising from the workplace design) in the development of chronic and acute diseases;</li><li>Increase the understanding of the links between different health-promoting factors in the working-built environment and physical and mental health outcomes, and how these may be mutually reinforcing;</li><li>Explore the health impacts of changing working times, including excessive and atypical working hours and work in different time zones that blur work from leisure time, limiting recovery. Effects should consider a wide range of diseases;</li><li>Provide recommendations for effective interventions to prevent occupational risks and support the mental and physical health and well-being at individual (worker), organisation (employer) and policy (government) levels for different sectors/types of work, including an analysis on their cost-effectiveness, sustainability and barriers to implementation at national and/or EU level;</li><li>Advance the development of a scientific framework addressing Occupational safety and health (OSH) across policies and sectors and support new and sustainable (future-proof) tools, guidelines and policies concerning the evaluation and design of physical and psychosocial work environment;</li><li>Provide tools and approaches to anticipate new OSH risks, also taking account of lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance in relation to digital technologies and associated new ways of working.</li> </ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Researchers should carefully integrate distributive considerations in their analysis by considering, where relevant, disaggregated effects for different socio-economic groups.</p><p>Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative<sup><a target=_self href=#fn5 id=r5>[5]</a></sup> by interacting with the NEB Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.</p><p>In order to optimise synergies and increase the impact of the projects, all projects selected for funding from this topic will form a cluster and be required to participate in common networking and joint activities.
