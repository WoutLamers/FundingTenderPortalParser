In addition to all these, this destination aims to contribute if necessary in the delivery of harmonization by means of contributing on the definition of European Standards.</p><p>Those objectives should be addressed aiming to deliver solutions in the following areas:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>Full digital freight train operations</strong> enabled by key technologies for transforming the European Rail Freight sector which will increase productivity (time and cost reduction), efficiency (through process automation) and service quality, all of that leading to an increase of competitiveness. Together with a \u201csmart\u201d increase of capacity, more freight traffic can be shifted to the European rail system, significantly contributing to the EU Green Deal. The development of innovative freight assets (e.g. innovative freight wagons, last mile solutions, terminals) allow to further improve the competitiveness of rail freight by reducing LCC <sup><sub>[Life Cycle Costs LCC]</sub></sup>, operational costs and also increasing automation.</li><li>A <strong>seamless rail freight</strong> with a significantly reduced average transportation time based on an agile, interoperable and open environment within integrated and harmonized European mobility networks which interacts with other businesses; an environment in which companies can optimize their operations; for railway undertakings and intermodal operators, this results into higher productivity, better capacity utilization, improved planning possibilities and, through the reduction of cross-border barriers and multimodality, faster transport handling, altogether resulting into higher reliability. In addition, comprehensive multimodal and transparent customer information in combination with easy booking and managing functions, lead to an increase in customer satisfaction and easier access to rail-based services. Being based on harmonized European data this leads to higher predictability and planning possibilities.</li> </ul><p><strong>The selected proposal for funding under this Destination will be a Flagship Project of Europe\u2019s Rail JU with significant expected impacts, which require an integrated sector systemic approach.</strong> Proposals, should therefore set out a credible pathway to contributing to all of the following expected impacts as described in the Europe Rail JU Master Plan.</p><table>  <tbody>   <tr>    <td> <p>Meeting evolving customer requirements</p> </td>    <td> <p>Improved EU rail supply industry competitiveness</p> </td>    <td> <p>More sustainable and resilient transport</p> </td>    <td> <p>Reinforced role for rail in European transport and mobility</p> </td>    <td> <p>Improved performance and capacity</p> </td>    <td colspan=\"3\"> <p>Reduced costs</p> </td>   </tr>  </tbody> </table><p>Proposals under this Destination should set appropriate monitoring and demonstration activities to measure the following KPIs:</p><p><strong>In the field of European full digital freight train operations</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Decrease train formation/decomposition (shunting/coupling/uncoupling) time:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Expected time reduction targeting 40-50%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Decrease train preparation/ departure process time:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Expected time reduction targeting 40-70%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Demonstrate increased average train length [m] up to maximum length in existing infrastructure limitations or higher loads:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Train length increased up to 1.500 m.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p><strong>In the field of seamless rail freight</strong></p><ul level=\"0\"><li>Reduce average transportation time on reference corridor   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Average transportation lead time reduced targeting towards the MAWP objective 10-20%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Reduce operational dwell time at borders and other handover points:   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Dwell time reduced targeting towards the MAWP objective 50%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Reduce the number of additional non-added value operational stops (limiting also the energy consumption):   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Reduced number of operational stops targeting 20%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Reduce handling/response time for ad-hoc cross-border path requests   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Reduced time by targeting towards the MAWP objective 70%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Reduce handling/response time for connected comprehensive intermodal offers   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Reduced response time by at least 30%, targeting the objective 50% as stated in MAWP 50%.</li>   </ul> </li><li>Reduced energy consumption and reduced footprint through less stops at borders   <ul level=\"1\"><li>Reduced energy consumption by a minimum of 6% targeting towards the overall MAWP objective of 10%.</li>   </ul> </li> </ul><p><strong>Expected Outcome:</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>Building upon the results of S2R IP5<sup><sub> [Results from Shift2Rail activities should be taken into account, please see FR8RAIL II (<a href=\"https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip5_n.aspx?p=FR8RAIL%20ii\">https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip5_n.aspx?p=FR8RAIL%20ii</a> ) D1.2-FR82 Automatic coupling and wagon design spec]</sub></sup> and European DAC Delivery Programme (EDDP) <sup><sub>[<a href=\"https://shift2rail.org/european-dac-delivery-programme/\">https://shift2rail.org/european-dac-delivery-programme/</a>]</sub></sup> in particular, and other rail research and innovation activities, the Flagship Project stemming from this topic is expected to contribute to Europe\u2019s Rail Programme addressing the two areas described in the previous Destination 5 section, more in particular addressing two workstreams :</p><ol level=\"0\">  <li><u>Work Stream WS1 Full digital Freight Train Operations<strong> </strong></u>with DAC as enabler for full digital freight train operation;</li> </ol><ol level=\"0\">  <li><u>Work Stream WS2 Seamless Freight: with </u>easy access and reliable (intermodal) transport service offering digital solutions.</li> </ol><p>For <strong>WS1</strong> this destination should deliver by 2025 the following demonstrators:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li><strong>European full digital freight train operations: </strong>(<strong>TRL 8-9) </strong>Large-scale demonstrator showing full digital freight train operations based on DAC Type 4 <sub><sup>[DAC Types definition can be found here </sup></sub><a href=\"https://shift2rail.org/european-dac-delivery-programme/\"><sub><sup>https://shift2rail.org/european-dac-delivery-programme/</sup></sub></a><sup><sub>]</sub></sup> (incl. energy supply &amp;
