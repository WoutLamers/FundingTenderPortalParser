To increase the railway capacity there are two main options: building new infrastructure and/or operating the rail system in a way that takes advantage of new technological and operational solutions. A major opportunity is offered by digitalization and automation of rail operation, where DATO (Digital \u201cAutomated\u201d Train Operations) represents the most visible result of a major transformation of rail operations, which builds upon a next generation of Automatic Train Control (ATC), in addition to enhancements on the Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS) allowing for integration at the on-board level. ATC<sup> <sub>[The ATS is responsible for \u201c[the] supervision of [the] train status, automatic routing selection, automatic schedule creation, automatic operations logging, statistics and report generation, and automatic system status monitoring\u201d. The ATP system is designed as a fail-safe system, intended to keep a safe distance between trains and to make each individual train comply with the track speed limits. If the speed limit is exceeded, ATP will automatically slow down the train or even bring it to a complete stop.
