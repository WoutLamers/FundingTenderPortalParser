As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates, most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe\u2019s autonomy, particularly in periods of geopolitical instability, exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components, Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment, electric and autonomous vehicles, manufacturing and production plants and equipment, telecom networks, aerospace vehicles, consumer products</p><p>R&amp;I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide, with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times, to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality (\u201cInternet of Senses\u201d). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.</p><p>Despite a strong European scientific community\u2019s on AI and robotics, Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, transport, agriculture, energy, construction), providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.</p><p>While Europe is strong in many sectors, it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness, prosperity and sustainability, by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies, e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches, use of biological elements as part of technology, and sustainable smart materials. In particular, the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet, but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.</p><p>In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118), in particular its \u2018secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures\u2019 pillar, actions under this Destination will support Europe\u2019s open strategic autonomy, and reinforce and regain European industry\u2019s leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene, and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</p><p>Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions, which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI, Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore, promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>As a result, this Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Ultra-low power processors</li></ul><p>Today Europe is not highly present in the microprocessor market. The objective of this heading is to ensure EU open strategic autonomy through the development of low-power, low environmental impact, secure and trusted components and software for strategic value-chains.</p><p>Proposals are invited under the topics of this heading in this work programme and under the topics of the \u2018Key Digital Technologies\u2019 Joint Undertaking addressing the electronics value chain (including software technologies).</p><ul><li>European Innovation Leadership in Electronics</li></ul><p>Europe currently has a leading position in key digital technologies for the strategic sectors of automotive, industrial manufacturing, aerospace, defence and security and healthcare. In the emerging area of post-Moore components, there is a number of promising technological approaches with no established players or dominant regions.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge digital technologies, to strengthen current leadership in strategic value-chains, and to seize emerging opportunities addressing existing technological gaps.</p><p>Proposals are invited under the topics of this heading in this work programme and under the topics of the \u2018Key Digital Technologies\u2019 Joint Undertaking addressing the electronics value chain (including software technologies).</p><ul><li>European Innovation Leadership in Photonics</li></ul><p>The European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments, far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications, and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.</p><p>The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership \u2018Photonics\u2019.</p><ul><li>6G and foundational connectivity technologies</li></ul><p>Today European suppliers of connectivity systems are well placed with around 40% of global 5G market share, but with high competitive pressure from Asian and US players. In terms of technology, first 5G standards are available since end of 2017 enabling Gigabit/s speeds and ~millisecond latencies. Trusted industrial services based on 5G technology are at very early stage.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a strong supply chain for connectivity, increase European competitiveness and autonomy in Internet infrastructures, and to contribute to a reduction of the growing global energy consumption of the Internet and of the industry vertical users of the Internet, and to other key SDG\u2019s such as affordability and accessibility to infrastructures. The topics under this work programme address in particular the need to develop micro electronic components and systems supporting future disaggregated Radio Access Networks and components enabling the advent of all optical networks for ultra low consumption and ultra high security networks.</p><p>Proposals are invited under the topics of this heading in this work programme and under the topics of the \u2018Smart Networks and Services\u201d Joint Undertaking addressing the future connectivity platforms including edge cloud and IoT technologies.</p><ul><li>Innovation in AI, Data and Robotics</li></ul><p>Europe has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research, Europe\u2019s scientific community is leading in AI and robotics, but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion, less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology, with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies, only capture 10% of full potential use, and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai\">https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai</a> (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, many AI, Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore, there is room for improved adoption by industry, which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&amp;I, from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general, industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies, but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, public sector, utilities, retail, finance, insurance, transport, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, construction, media, creative and cultural industries, fashion, tourism, etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership \u2018AI, Data and Robotics\u2019.</p><ul><li>Tomorrow\u2019s deployable Robots: efficient, robust, safe, adaptive and trusted</li></ul><p>Europe is leading in robotics industry, with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics\u2019 cognition, safety, manipulation, soft robotics, underwater and aerial robotics, with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare, agri-food[[<span style=\"color:rgb(68,68,68);\">The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming, fisheries,</span></p><p><span style=\"color:rgb(68,68,68);\">horticulture etc as well as produce processing, ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.</span>]], forestry, inspection and maintenance, logistics, construction, manufacturing, etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial, marine, ground, in-vivo and space).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership \u2018AI, Data and Robotics\u2019.</p><ul><li>European leadership in Emerging Enabling Technologies</li></ul><p>Europe\u2019s leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement, but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged, with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech, though, this intertwining is essential.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe\u2019s future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.</p><ul><li>Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm Shift</li></ul><p>Since 2018, the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe\u2019s scientific leadership and excellence in quantum, in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU\u2019s aims for quantum R&amp;I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship\u2019s Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402\">https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402</a>]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators,[[Link to provide later]] which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship, by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing, simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership, capitalising on Europe\u2019s established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.</p><p>The aim of the Commission\u2019s Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world, and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty, as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used, among others, for sensitive applications in the area of security, and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context, the EU must take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets, interests, autonomy and security, while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.</p><p>The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators, that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact, with applications in medicine, manufacturing, or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography, finance and many other sensitive domains.</p><p>Moreover, the Flagship\u2019s research into quantum communication will support the development of a European quantum communication infrastructure (EuroQCI). This key component of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy will provide an extremely secure form of encryption to shield the EU\u2019s government data and critical infrastructures against cyber-attacks. Ensuring that the latest quantum communication technologies remain accessible in the EU is crucial to maintaining European security in the face of future threats.</p><p>Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU\u2019s interests, as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications, sensors for autonomous vehicles, and the next generation of medical sensors.</p><p>It is therefore clearly in the EU\u2019s interests to protect European research in these domains, the intellectual property that it generates, and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result, while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe\u2019s strategic dependencies). With this in mind, the Commission has decided that, in the research areas covered by 12 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation, communication, and sensing, only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.</p><p>The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to legal entities established in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Israel and the United Kingdom. The eligibility of entities established in the UK to participate is conditional upon reciprocity of access to equivalent UK programmes for entities established in Member States, which will be assessed by the Commission as soon as such programmes are established and in any event before the signature of the grant agreements. Should the UK not open the participation in its relevant programmes to entities established in Member States, this condition would not be met and entities established in the UK will not be eligible to participate in this topic.</p><ul><li>Graphene: Europe in the lead</li></ul><p>The starting point is the Graphene Flagship, launched in 2013, which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&amp;I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation, automotive, electronics, batteries, healthcare).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes.</p><p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to <strong>digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal</strong>, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Europe\u2019s open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI, data, robotics, quantum computing, and graphene, and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</li><li>Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.</li><li>Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms.</li></ul>", "destinationDescription": "Digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal", "topicMGAs": [], "tags": ["quantum technologies", "basic research"], "keywords": ["Digital Agenda", "Quantum Technologies (computing/communication)", "Computer sciences, information science and bioinfo", "Artificial Intelligence"], "flags": ["DigitalAgenda", "AI"], "sme": false, "actions": [{"status": {"id": 31094503, "abbreviation": "Closed", "description": "Closed"}, "types": [{"typeOfAction": "HORIZON-RIA HORIZON  Research and Innovation Actions", "typeOfMGA": [{"id": 43027846, "abbreviation": "HORIZON-AG", "description": "HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based"}]}], "plannedOpeningDate": "02 November 2021", "submissionProcedure": {"id": 31094504, "abbreviation": "single-stage", "description": "single-stage"}, "deadlineDates": ["27 January 2022"]}], "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 25, 2022 11:31:15 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 25, 2022 11:31:15 AM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Submissions to the topic HORIZON-CL4-2021-DIGITAL-EMERGING-02-16 - Basic Science for Quantum Technologies (RIA):</span><span style=\"mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:&#10;minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;&#10;color:#1F497D;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">31 proposals</span></strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"> (indicative budget 16 EUR million).</span><span style=\"mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-ascii-theme-font:&#10;minor-latin;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;&#10;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;&#10;color:#1F497D;mso-fareast-language:EN-US\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Dec 22, 2021 3:23:52 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 22, 2021 3:23:52 PM", "content": "<p>&nbsp;<span lang=\"EN-US\">In line with the eligibility conditions of the topic which call for an assessment of control,&nbsp;</span>all applicants (except entities validated as public bodies in the Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Participant Register) are required to complete a questionnaire on the declaration of ownership and control by the application deadline.
