Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>\u2018Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare\u2019 </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: \u2018<em>h</em><em>ealth care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety\u2019</em></span>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>\u2018A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats\u2019</em>, <em>\u2018Climate change mitigation and adaptation\u2019</em>, and <em>\u2018High quality digital services for all\u2019</em>.</p><p><span>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs</span>[[<span>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated \u20ac115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).</span>]]<span>. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions</span>[[<span>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.</span>]]<span>.</span></p><p><span>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</span></p><p><span>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission\u2019s political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policy-making; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</span></p><p><span>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>\u201cCivil security for society\u201d</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical counter measures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>\u201cDigital, Industry and Space\u201d</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>\u201cFood, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment\u201d</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health).</span></p><p><span>Some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the announced \u201cEurope\u2019s Beating Cancer Plan\u201d</span>[[<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan\"><span>https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</span></a>]]<span>, contributing to actions covering the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)</span>[[<span>https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</span>]]<span>. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.</span></p><p><u><span>Expected impacts: </span></u></p><p><span>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</span></p><ul level=\"0\"><li><span>Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care.

The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members funding agencies and aligned with the GACD call 2021.</span></p><p><span>The topic is focused on implementation research about common risk prevention interventions targeting adolescents and youth to reduce the impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and vulnerable populations in high-income countries (HICs). Proposals should focus on implementation science around evidence-based interventions that promote healthy behaviours, and that have the potential to profoundly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and multimorbidity. </span></p><p><span>The GACD Alliance is particularly interested in funding projects that focus on interventions that reduce health risk and/or enhance a healthy lifestyle in young people, which the WHO defines as the period from ages 10-24 and includes adolescence (ages 10-19) and youth (15-24). Adolescence and youth mark a period of emerging independence and an important time for laying the foundations of good health. Adolescence and youth is a period in life where patterns of behaviour are established around diet, physical activity, substance use and sexual activity, which can affect their health in the present; in their future adult lives; and even in the next generation. In the transition from childhood to adulthood, young people become increasingly exposed to harmful products such as tobacco, alcohol and drugs, and can experience devastating mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, self-harm, substance abuse and addictions, as well as eating disorders and suicide. Over 150 million young people smoke; 81% adolescents do not meet physical activity guidelines; 11.7% of adolescents partake in heavy episodic drinking; and suicide has emerged as a leading cause of death in young people globally. </span></p><p><span>All proposals must make the case for why their selected life stage is a critical period for the reduction of NCD risk in the communities where the research will be undertaken. There are a range of evidence-based interventions, including the WHO Best Buys, which aim to reduce the health risks associated with common NCD risk factors. Implementation research is necessary to understand the uptake, accessibility, acceptability, adaption, sustainability and costs of known interventions for use in young adults and adolescents. Applicants are invited to consider interventions at the individual, family, community (e.g., work or school) or population level. Multi-sectoral approaches and a combination of different types of interventions, including biomedical, digital (such as artificial intelligence and big data), socio-behavioural, and/or structural</span><sup><a target=_self href=#fn1 id=r1>[1]</a></sup><span> are encouraged. Projects will be expected to build on evidence-based interventions that focus on prevention interventions and strategies that reduce common risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases, or that promote healthy behaviours. Such interventions/strategies might include, but are not limited to, those in the following three areas: nutrition, physical activity, and/or sleep; tobacco, substance abuse and/or alcohol use; social wellbeing and </span><span>loneliness</span> <span>. Proposals should be gender-responsive and consider socioeconomic, racial or other factors that relate to equitable impacts of the intervention or barriers to equitable implementation.</span></p><p><span>Proposals should include implementation research outcomes (e.g. feasibility, fidelity and/or adaptation, spread and/or penetration, acceptability, sustainability, uptake, and cost effectiveness) and where relevant, include service outcomes (e.g. efficiency, safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness). The aim is to harmonise the research common goals and the outcomes assessment of GACD-funded projects in order to maximise the potential for learning across the network and the impact of the initiative as a whole. To this end, all funded teams are expected to use explicit indicators and measures of project context, reach, outcomes evaluation and scale-up potential in their plans and protocols. In this topic, the use of the following measures is encouraged: evidence of uptake of promoted healthy behaviours; evidence of reduction in harmful behaviours; and proxy mental and/or physical health outcomes, if appropriate (pre- and post- intervention PHQ-9 scores, blood pressure, HbA1C, etc.).</span></p><p><span>Proposals should include a strategy to include policy makers and local authorities, as well as other relevant stakeholders such as community groups. Such engagement should inform the conception and development of the project and should continue throughout the duration of project and afterwards during the knowledge translation phase. Participants that are local stakeholders can be powerful assets to the projects indeed. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement throughout all phases of the project, not only as participants in the research undertaken. </span></p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Cross-cutting Priorities</SPAN>:<p><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=EC-WORLD;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">International Cooperation</a><br>Social sciences and humanities<br><a href=\"//ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programCcm2Id=43108390;crossCuttingPriorityCode=SocietalEngagement;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc\">Societal Engagement</a><br>Digital Agenda<br>Artificial Intelligence<br></p>\n<p id=fn1><a  target=_self href=#r1>[1]</a><span>Structural interventions are defined as interventions that attempt to change the social, physical, economic, or political environments in order to improve health behaviours and outcomes, altering the larger social context by which health disparities emerge and persist.
