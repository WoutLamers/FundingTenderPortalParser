Works in the meaning of CEF Energy include the purchase, supply and deployment of components, systems and services including software, the development, construction and installation activities relating to a CB RES project, the acceptance of installations and the launching of a CB RES project. Applications related to construction works must comply with the specific conditions laid down in the CEF regulation for this project category. In particular, specific conditions relate to, inter alia, the existence of significant cost savings and/or benefits in terms of system integration, environmental sustainability, security of supply and innovation, as well as the commercial non-viability of the envisaged investments. Only projects contributing to CB RES projects as identified in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2202 shall be eligible for support through EU financial aid in the form of grants.</p><p>Works proposals related to project components that are covered by the Article 3 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/342 are eligible. For each of the CB RES projects, the list of components that are included in the CB RES status can be found in the technical documentation supporting the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2022 that establishes the CB RES list. All other things being equal, proposals for works which relate to renewables generation components will be given priority over proposals which relate to non-RES components through the award criterion \u2018Priority and urgency\u2019.</p><p>If a proposal for works contains a non-RES component, then it has to justify <u>the necessity of this component to the overall CB RES project implementation, and prove that the component is essential for the renewable energy generation.</u></p><p>Only projects in conformity with EU law and which are in line with the relevant EU policies shall be financed, in particular those relating to competition, protection of the environment, state aid and public procurement. In line with Article 11 of the CEF Regulation, to be eligible, proposals shall either be submitted by one or more Member States or have the agreement of the Member States concerned as expressed through the letter of support. The letter of support shall be signed by the ministries of the participating Member States in charge of implementing the cooperation agreement for the underlying CB RES project.</p>\n", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> </span></p>\r\n<h1><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Conditions</span></span></span></b></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/cef/wp-call/2023/call-fiche_cef-e-2023-cbrenew_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

For the funding period 2021-2027, a new category of eligible projects features in the energy part of the revised CEF programme - cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy (from now onwards referred to as CB RES projects) as defined in Article 7 of the CEF Regulation. The support for renewable energy under the revised CEF programme is to be seen in the context of the increased ambition as per the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:562:FIN\">Climate Target Plan</a> and of the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A221%3AFIN\">strategies on Solar energy</a>, <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A741%3AFIN\">Offshore renewable energy</a>, on <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2020:299:FIN\">Energy system integration</a> and <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:301:FIN\">hydrogen</a>. Moreover, the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A230%3AFIN\">REPowerEU</a> sets new actions to increase the resilience of the EU-wide energy system in order to phase out our dependency on fossil fuels from Russia well before 2030.</p><p>The window for renewable energy within CEF (= 15 % earmarking under CEF Energy, i.e. 875 million \u20ac in current prices, subject to market uptake) responds to a renewed focus on regional and cross-border cooperation in the deployment of renewable energy in the Clean Energy Package. The <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32018L2001\">Renewable Energy Directive</a> states that the Commission shall support Member States\u2019 ambition level in the field of renewables through an enabling framework, including the use of EU funds, for the purpose of enhancing regional cooperation between Member States and between Member States and third countries. The window for renewable energy within CEF is part of this enabling framework, alongside the Union Renewable Development Platform and the EU renewable energy financing mechanism. Cooperation on the deployment of renewables allows for a more cost-effective upscaling by using the locations with the best potential, pooling resources and through joint renewable generation planning. Cooperation can contribute to further alignment of renewable energy policies, supports the ongoing work in regional energy forums (including the North Seas Energy Cooperation \u2013 NESC, the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan \u2013 BEMIP, the Central and South-Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity \u2013 CESEC, Interconnections for South-West Europe and the Pentalateral Forum) and reinforces the EU\u2019s technology leadership in the field of renewables. Furthermore, CB RES projects should contribute to decarbonisation, completing the internal energy market and enhancing security of supply. The window for renewable energy within CEF complements other EU funding opportunities for renewable energy. Renewable investments feature prominently in the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021R0241&amp;qid=1697528492148\">Regulation (EU) 2021/241 establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility</a> (RRF) setting out the common objective of funding 40 % of the additional 500 GW capacity needed by 2030 as part of the POWER Up flagship. The combination of financing from the market, Member States, the RRF, CEF, <a href=\"http://investeu.europa.eu/index_en\">InvestEU programme </a>and other EU programmes should ensure the necessary large-scale deployment of renewables to reach the renewable energy target in 2030 and putting the EU on track for carbon neutrality by 2050. The speed of deployment of renewable energy will need to double over the next decade. The upscaling of renewable electricity needs to keep pace with the electrification of energy-using sectors and an expected doubling of the share of electricity in final energy demand by 2050 (<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM%3A2018%3A773%3AFIN\">see</a>) . The CEF window for renewable energy can support mainstreaming of renewable energy in energy-using sectors, facilitate sector integration (including as part of CEF synergy projects) and hence make an important contribution to the clean energy transition. All investments in generation assets based on any of the renewable sources listed under the Article 2 of the Renewable Energy Directive are eligible as CB RES projects. These projects can relate to, inter alia, electricity, heating &amp; cooling and transport sector investments, also when they are integrated in and framing broader investment projects (e.g. renewable hydrogen project). A CB RES project can also combine different renewable energy technologies. The Article 7 of the CEF Regulation defines the scope of the CB RES projects and Part IV of the Annex to the CEF Regulation defines the objectives and the cumulative selection criteria to apply.</p><p>Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/342 (CB RES Delegated Regulation) further defines, inter alia, the components that can be part of a CB RES project. Notably, it is clarified under article 3 that in addition to the generation of renewable energy, the CB RES projects may include additional technologies, components and investments, provided that they meet the selection criteria listed under Article 3 of the Delegated Regulation 2022/342. A CB RES project means a project selected or eligible to be selected under a cooperation agreement or any other kind of arrangement between two or more Member States or arrangements between one or more Member States and one or more third countries as described under Articles 9 to 13 of the Renewable Energy Directive, without having necessarily a physical link to all the participating countries. The cooperation agreement can concern an exchange of renewables statistics against a payment (statistical transfer) or relate to an entire support scheme with various projects (joint support scheme), in addition to the option of working together on a specific project (joint project). Joint projects between MS and third countries must comply with the requirements detailed under the Article 11 of the Renewable Energy Directive. The list of CB RES status projects eligible for funding under this call for proposals has been adopted by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2202.</p><p>Based on the provisions of the Article 7 and Part IV of Annex to the CEF Regulation, CB RES projects shall promote cross-border cooperation between Member States in the field of planning, development and the cost-effective exploitation of renewable energy sources, as well as facilitate their integration through energy storage facilities and with the aim of contributing to the Union\u2019s long term decarbonisation strategy, completing the internal energy market and enhancing the security of supply. Both topics under this call aim to support and contribute to the implementation of CB RES projects included in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2202.</p><p>Both topics under this call aim to enable CB RES projects which have significant socio economic benefits to be implemented, within the framework of the renewable energy sector and in particular to support cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy. In particular, the financial assistance under this call for proposals shall contribute to supporting CB RES projects that do not receive adequate financing from the market and should maximise its added value towards uptake of renewable energy investments. The objective of studies and works is to support and contribute to the implementation of CB RES projects. It is considered that the EU added value of an action related to a CB RES project is demonstrated by the CB RES status itself.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Dec 19, 2023 12:00:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Dec 19, 2023 12:00:01 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CEF-E-2023-CBRENEW-STUDIES(CEF-PJG), CEF-E-2023-CBRENEW-WORKS(CEF-INFRA)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
