For the funding period 2021-2027, a new category of eligible projects features in the energy part of the revised CEF programme - <strong>cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy</strong> (from now onwards, referred to as cross-border RES projects) as defined in Article 7 of the CEF Regulation. The support for renewable energy under the revised CEF programme is to be seen in the context of the increased ambition as per t<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:562:FIN\">he Climate Target Plan</a> and of <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A741%3AFIN\">the strategies on offshore renewable energy</a>, on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2020:299:FIN\">energy system integration</a> and on <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020DC0301\">hydrogen</a>.</p><p>The new window (= 15 % earmarking under CEF energy, i.e. 875 mn \u20ac in current prices, subject to market uptake) under the CEF Regulation responds to a renewed focus on regional and cross-border cooperation in the deployment of renewable energy in Europe in the Clean Energy Package. <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.328.01.0082.01.ENG\">The Renewable Energy Directive</a> states that the Commission shall support Member States\u2019 ambition level in the field of renewables through an enabling framework, including the use of Union funds, for the purpose of enhancing regional cooperation between Member States and between Member States and third countries. The new CEF window is part of this enabling framework, alongside the Union renewable development platform and the Union renewable energy financing mechanism.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive also sets out four types of cooperation mechanisms that can be used for cooperation: statistical transfers (Art 8), joint projects between Member States (Art 9), joint projects between Member States and third countries (Art 11) and joint support schemes (Art 13). The definition of cross-border RES projects as per Article 2 (k) of CEF Regulation, builds up on those concepts for its eligibility criteria.</p><p>Cross-border RES projects also contribute to the 60 % climate-related spending set for the CEF with such projects counting 100 % (as per Article 4 and recital 5 of the Regulation) for all renewable generation, provided that for bioenergy the sustainability criteria of the Renewable Energy Directive are met.</p><p>Cooperation on the deployment of renewables allows for a more cost-effective upscaling when the locations with the best potential are used, resources are pooled and renewable generation planning and deployment takes place. Cooperation can contribute to further alignment of renewable energy policies, supports the ongoing work in regional energy forums (including the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NESC), Baltic energy market interconnection plan (BEMIP), Central and South Eastern Europe energy connectivity (CESEC), Pentalateral Forum) and contributes to the strategic uptake of renewable technologies to maintain and expand the Union\u2019s technology leadership in the field of renewables. Furthermore, cross-border RES projects should contribute to decarbonisation, completing the internal energy market and enhancing the security of supply by promoting the cross-border cooperation between Member States in the field of planning, development and the cost-effective exploitation of renewable energy sources.</p><p>The new window for renewable energy within CEF complements other EU funding opportunities for renewable energy and it has a specific focus on cross-border cooperation to optimise national renewable energy planning and development. Renewable investments feature prominently also in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) with the European Commission setting out the common objective of funding 40 % of the additional 500 GW capacity needed by 2030 as part of the POWER Up flagship. Combining grants from the CEF Programme with loans, guarantees or equity contributions under <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R0523\">InvestEU</a> is possible. The combination of financing from the market, Member States, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, CEF, InvestEU and other Union programmes should ensure the necessary large-scale deployment of renewables to reach at least 32 % of final energy consumption in renewable energy in 2030 (target under revision), and putting the EU on track for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The speed of deployment of renewable energy will need to double over the next decade. The upscaling of renewables electricity in particular needs to keep pace with the electrification of energy-using sectors and an expected doubling of the share of electricity in final energy demand by 2050. The new CEF window for renewable energy can support mainstreaming of renewable energy in energy-using sectors, facilitate sector integration (including as part of CEF synergy projects) and hence make an important contribution to the energy transition in a wider sense.</p><p><span><span>All investments in generation assets based on any of the renewable sources listed in the Renewable Energy Directive are eligible and can relate to, inter alia, electricity, heating &amp; cooling and transport sector investments, also when they are integrated in and framing broader investment projects e.g. on renewable hydrogen - A c-b RES project can also combine different renewable energy technologies, and it can contain a component on storage as part of the investment (both on- and offsite) or a component that is needed for the integration of the renewables generation site into the grid/heating system is also eligible for CEF. Such c-b RES projects must be framed under a cooperation mechanism in accordance with Articles 8 to 13 of the Renewable Energy Directive and may, but do not necessarily have to, have a physical link to more than one Member State. The cooperation mechanisms can be about an exchange of renewables statistics against a financial transfer (statistical transfer) or relate to an entire support scheme with various projects (joint support scheme) instead of linking to a specific project. </span></span></p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Feb 3, 2022 3:48:10 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Feb 3, 2022 3:48:10 PM", "content": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The </span>CEF 2 Energy Call for Cross-border renewable energy projects -preparatory studies&nbsp; closed at 17.00hrs on 1.2.2022.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3 proposals were submitted for evaluation, with a total cost of approx. 1 M&euro; and requesting an EC contribution of &nbsp;approx. 0,47 M&euro;.<o:p></o:p></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 18, 2021 11:43:01 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 18, 2021 11:43:01 AM", "content": "<p><strong>Deadline of&nbsp;CEF-E-2021-CBRENEW-PREPSTUDIES has been extended until 1.2.2022</strong></p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 23, 2021 3:11:50 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 23, 2021 3:11:50 PM", "content": "<p><a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/news/2021-cef-energy-virtual-info-day-call-proposals-preparatory-studies-cross-border-renewable_en\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Info Day </a>on the call for proposals for preparatory studies for cross-border renewable energy projects 28.9.2021</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Sep 22, 2021 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Sep 22, 2021 12:00:00 AM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CEF-E-2021-CBRENEW-PREPSTUDIES(CEF-PJG)"}], "hasForthcomingTopics": false, "hasOpenTopics": false, "allClosedTopics": true}}}
