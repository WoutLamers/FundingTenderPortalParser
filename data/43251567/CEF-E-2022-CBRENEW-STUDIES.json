A study could cover in-depth investigation and exploration of the risk factors of a project e.g. safety, technical, environmental, regulatory, economic or legal issues to determine whether and how the project should be implemented.</p><p>A study could also be used to set out in detail the operational aspects of a cooperation, such as the precise legal set up of the financing arrangement e.g. the cross-border tender or the regulatory set up of the cooperation project. For more mature projects, a study may have the objective to move the project through the development stage to a Final Investment Decision (FID) and may include Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies, technical design studies, geophysical surveys, seabed surveys, tasks related to territorial planning, environmental assessments and comparable studies as applicable.

For the funding period 2021-2027, a new category of eligible projects features in the energy part of the revised CEF programme - cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy (from now onwards, referred to as CB RES projects) as defined in Article 7 of the CEF Regulation. The support for renewable energy under the revised CEF programme is to be seen in the context of the increased ambition as per t<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:562:FIN\">he Climate Target Plan</a> and of <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A221%3AFIN\">the strategies on solar energy</a>, <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A741%3AFIN\">offshore renewable energy</a>, on <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2020:299:FIN\">energy system integration</a> and on <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2020:301:FIN\">hydrogen</a> . Moreover, the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A230%3AFIN\">REPowerEU plan</a> sets new actions to increase the resilience of the EU-wide energy system in order to phase out our dependency on fossil fuels from Russia well before 2030.</p><p>The window for renewable energy within CEF (= 15 % earmarking under CEF energy, i.e. 875 million \u20ac in current prices, subject to market uptake) responds to a renewed focus on regional and cross-border cooperation in the deployment of renewable energy in the Clean Energy Package. <a href=\"http://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en#:~:text=Directive%202018%2F2001%2FEU%20The%20current%20Renewable%20Energy%20Directive%202018%2F2001%2FEU,its%20emissions%20reduction%20commitments%20under%20the%20Paris%20Agreement.\">The Renewable Energy Directive</a> states that the Commission shall support Member States\u2019 ambition level in the field of renewables through an enabling framework, including the use of EU funds, for the purpose of enhancing regional cooperation between Member States and between Member States and third countries. The window for renewable energy within CEF is part of this enabling framework, alongside the Union Renewable Development Platform and the EU renewable energy financing mechanism.</p><p>Cooperation on the deployment of renewables allows for a more cost-effective upscaling by using the locations with the best potential, pooling resources and through joint renewable generation planning. Cooperation can contribute to further alignment of renewable energy policies, supports the ongoing work in regional energy forums (including the North Seas Energy Cooperation \u2013 NESC, the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan \u2013 BEMIP, the Central and South Eastern Europe Energy Connectivity \u2013 CESEC, and the Pentalateral Forum) and reinforces the EU\u2019s technology leadership in the field of renewables. Furthermore, cross-border RES projects should contribute to decarbonisation, completing the internal energy market and enhancing security of supply.</p><p>The window for renewable energy within CEF complements other EU funding opportunities for renewable energy. Renewable investments feature prominently in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) with the European Commission setting out the common objective of funding 40 % of the additional 500 GW capacity needed by 2030 as part of the POWER Up flagship. The combination of financing from the market, Member States, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, CEF, InvestEU and other EU programmes should ensure the necessary large-scale deployment of renewables to reach the renewable energy target in 2030, and putting the EU on track for carbon neutrality by 2050. The speed of deployment of renewable energy will need to double over the next decade. The upscaling of renewable electricity in particular needs to keep pace with the electrification of energy-using sectors and an expected doubling of the share of electricity in final energy demand by 2050 (<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM%3A2018%3A773%3AFIN\">see</a>). The CEF window for renewable energy can support mainstreaming of renewable energy in energy-using sectors, facilitate sector integration (including as part of CEF synergy projects) and hence make an important contribution to the clean energy transition.</p><p>All investments in generation assets based on any of the renewable sources listed in the Renewable Energy Directive (article 2) are eligible as CB RES projects and can relate to, inter alia, electricity, heating &amp; cooling and transport sector investments, also when they are integrated in and framing broader investment projects e.g. on renewable hydrogen. A CB RES project can also combine different renewable energy technologies, and it can contain a component on storage as part of the investment (both on- and offsite) or a component that is needed for the integration of the renewables generation site into the grid/heating system. However, in case of works priority will be given to proposals with proportionally high RES generation component.</p><p>The CB RES projects must be framed under a cooperation mechanism in accordance with Articles 8 to 13 of the Renewable Energy Directive and may, but do not necessarily have to have a physical link to all the participating Member States. The cooperation mechanisms can be about an exchange of renewables statistics against a payment (statistical transfer) or relate to an entire support scheme with various projects (joint support scheme), in addition to the option of working together on a specific project (joint project). Joint projects between MS and third countries can be also envisaged as per Article 11 of the Renewable Energy Directive, however specific conditions apply. In particular, there should be a physical link to an EU MS.</p><p>Please note that this call is open only to the projects selected for the CB RES list and it contains three projects.</p><p>The delegated regulation containing the list of the CB RES projects enters into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>\n", "latestInfos": [{"approvalDate": "Mar 8, 2023 3:44:29 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 8, 2023 3:44:29 PM", "content": "<p>The CEF 2 Energy Call for Cross-border renewable energy projects closed at 17.00hrs on 23.2.2023.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: eui-light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6px; background-color: rgb(198, 219, 239);\">3 proposals were submitted for evaluation, with a total cost of approximately 87 M&euro; and requesting an EC contribution of approximately 43 M&euro;.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Mar 8, 2023 3:41:10 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Mar 8, 2023 3:41:10 PM", "content": "<p>The submission session is now available for: CEF-E-2022-CBRENEW-WORKS(CEF-INFRA), CEF-E-2022-CBRENEW-STUDIES(CEF-PJG)</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: eui-light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6px; background-color: rgb(198, 219, 239);\">The CEF 2 Energy Call for Cross-border renewable energy projects closed at 17.00hrs on 23.2.2023.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: eui-light, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6px; background-color: rgb(198, 219, 239);\">3 proposals were submitted for evaluation, with a total cost of approximately 87 M&euro; and requesting an EC contribution of approximately 43 M&euro;.</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 24, 2022 5:14:20 PM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 24, 2022 5:14:20 PM", "content": "The submission session is now available for: CEF-E-2022-CBRENEW-WORKS(CEF-INFRA), CEF-E-2022-CBRENEW-STUDIES(CEF-PJG)"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 14, 2022 10:56:24 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 14, 2022 10:56:24 AM", "content": "<p><a href=\"http://file:///C:/Users/urpalkr/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/721XB8OY/Delegated%20Regulation%20(EU)%202022-2202.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/2202 of 29 August 2022 establishing a list of selected cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy</a>&nbsp;has been published&nbsp;14.11.2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}, {"approvalDate": "Nov 8, 2022 12:00:00 AM", "lastChangeDate": "Nov 8, 2022 12:00:00 AM", "content": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;font-style: inherit;font-weight: inherit\">The delegated regulation containing the list of the CB RES projects will enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
