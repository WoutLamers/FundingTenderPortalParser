It emphasises the necessity to speed up the implementation of infrastructure projects completing the internal energy market with a strong cross-border dimension as to improve the interconnection of the European gas and electricity networks as well as fully synchronise our power grids.</p><p>Adequate, well-integrated and reliable energy networks are a prerequisite for a secure, sustainable and competitive internal energy market.

While the bulk of the investment needed in the energy sector should be delivered by the market and its costs recovered through tariffs, EU financing may be needed for specific projects with wider regional and European benefits which are unable to attract market-based financing.
