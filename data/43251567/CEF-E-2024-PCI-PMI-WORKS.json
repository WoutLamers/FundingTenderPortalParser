Any eligibility for Union financial assistance under Article 18 shall end on 31 December 2027. Any request for Union financial assistance for works shall clearly demonstrate the aim to convert the asset into a dedicated hydrogen asset by 2036 if market conditions allow, by means of a roadmap with a precise timeline. The derogation set out in paragraph 1 of the Article shall apply until Cyprus or Malta, respectively, is directly interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 December 2029, whichever is the earlier.
