Cross-border renewable energy projects are defined in Article 2 (k) of the CEF Regulation: \u201ccross-border project in the field of renewable energy\u201d means a project selected or eligible to be selected under a cooperation agreement or any other kind of arrangement between two or more Member States or arrangements between one or more Member States and one or more third countries as set out in Articles 8, 9, 11 and 13 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 in the planning or deployment of renewable energy, in accordance with the criteria set out in Part IV of the Annex to this Regulation. On that basis, <strong>a proposal for preparatory study should demonstrate in its scope the link to planning or deployment of renewable energy</strong>. Without a renewable energy component, a proposal would not meet the main requirement for a preparatory study.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Objective</SPAN>:<p>The <strong>objective of</strong><strong> this call</strong> is to support <strong>preparatory studies</strong> as per <strong>Article 7(3)</strong> of the CEF Regulation, e.g. to develop and identify CB RES projects. Such studies can assist project promoters in selecting the best project concept and setting up the cooperation agreement, allowing for projects to be supported prior to having acquired the official status of a CB RES project (CB RES status).</p><p>Please note that proposals under this call cannot combine preparatory studies and technical studies and works. For the technical studies and works, separate calls for proposals are launched, and a precondition for eligibility is first to receive the CB RES status.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Scope</SPAN>:<p>Preparatory studies in the meaning of Article 7(3) of the CEF Regulation allow for support to both EU Member States but also private project promoters in order to advance cooperation ideas, create momentum amongst involved stakeholders and with this generate a pipeline of CB RES projects. They provide specifically support to the project before aquiring the CB RES status.</p><p>The purpose of support for preparatory studies is to overcome the obstacles that have in the past prevented cooperation projects from going ahead, such as uncertainty on the allocation of costs and benefits between involved Member States or the additional complexity of setting up cross-border support.</p><p>Applications related to preparatory studies must comply with the CEF Regulation and with the specific conditions set out in this call.</p><p>Proposals contributing to the development of the future CB RES project generation delivering in any of the RES technologies as defined in Article 2 of the Renewable Energy Directive (EU)are eligible.</p><p>Projects that contribute to the REPowerEU objectives and the initiatives, announced as part of the REPowerEU plan from May 2022, would be particularly relevant for the call. This is valid for projects that are in line with the EU solar strategy and the European Solar Rooftop Initiative and would contribute to the REPowerEU target of over 320 GW of solar photovoltaic newly installed by 2025 and almost 600 GW by 2030. Relevant would also be projects that accelerate renewable hydrogen as a replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport and contribute to the REPowerEU target of 10 million tonnes of domestic renewable hydrogen production.</p><p>A <strong>proposal for a preparatory study should demonstrate in its scope the link to planning or deployment of renewable energy</strong>.</p><p>A study in the meaning of Article 7(3) of the CEF Regulation can be designed as a pre-feasibility study. The funding can also be used to provide technical, economic or legal support in setting up or advancing cross-border cooperation with the objective to select the best project concept. As part of such a preparatory study, it is possible to cover also some wider system-related aspects, e.g. the integration of additional storage investments, or of transport and/or digital related investments for synergetic elements.</p><p>A study can be used to start exploring (mainly through desktop studies) the possible sites in the territory of Member States (and third countries if applicable) in order to determine the hosting and off-taking (contributing) countries, as well as other exploratory tasks needed to assess the overall cost and benefits of the project. It should allow identifying and formalising the underpinning cooperation mechanism and can include related communication and stakeholder involvement activities.</p><p>A study may also investigate the best form of support, such as auctioning and tendering set-up as well as all aspects for which national grid, market and other rules differ in the participating Member States and would need to be agreed upon for a CB RES project to go ahead.</p><p>Examples of activities, which could be part of studies as per Article 7 (3) of the CEF Regulation, include:</p><ul level=\"0\"><li>pre-feasibility studies, used to start exploring (mainly through desktop studies) the possible geographical sites ;</li><li>exploratory tasks to assess the overall cost and benefits of the project; first evaluation of overall cost and benefits of the project, including cost of energy generation, system integration, cost of support, greenhouse gas emissions, security of supply, air and other local pollution, innovation;</li><li>analysis of wider system-related aspects e.g. aspects of market and grid integration, grid financing aspects, the integration of additional storage investments, or of transport and/or digital related investments for synergetic elements;</li><li>identification of possible financing sources, assessing Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) potential;</li><li>communication and stakeholder involvement activities;</li><li>cooperation activities between Member States, including the assessment of cost-benefit sharing.</li> </ul><p>In case the proposal concerns the development of the cooperation activities between Member States, applicants may need to contact the relevant authority of the concerned Member State. Applicants are strongly encouraged to get in touch with the relevant authority as early as possible. Please refer to the CB RES Member States contact points available in the <a href=\"https://cinea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/connecting-europe-facility/energy-infrastructure-connecting-europe-facility-0/cross-border-renewable-energy-projects-cef-energy-new_en\"><strong>Programme website</strong></a>.</p><p>Proposals can be composed of single applicant or based on a consortium. It is not necessary to have participants from all concerned countries in which the project will be implemented. This choice is the remit of applicants, depending on the proposals\u2019 objectives, activities and expected impact.</p><p>In line with Article 11 of the CEF Regulation, to be eligible, proposals shall either be submitted by one or more Member States or have the agreement of the Member States concerned as expressed through the letter of support.</p>\n<SPAN class=\"topicdescriptionkind\">Expected Impact</SPAN>:<p>This call for proposals aims at financing projects contributing to the goals and objectives of the European Green Deal, as well as the Paris Agreement and the 2030 climate and energy targets and the EU's mid-term and long-term objectives in terms of decarbonisation, in accordance with recitals 5 and 30 of the CEF Regulation and in line with the Multi-annual Work Programme.</p><p>It is expected that the financial assistance under this call contributes to the further identification and development of the envisaged CB RES projects. Cross-border RES projects are expected to contribute to a cost-effective achievement of renewables target by 2030 in the EU (as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2018/2001/EC) and to the strategic uptake of renewables technologies and is an integral element of the enabling framework for regional and cross-border cooperation on renewables<em>.</em></p>\n", "conditions": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> </span></p>\r\n<h1><b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 18.4px; color: rgb(64, 64, 64);\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Conditions</span></span></span></b></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Admissibility conditions: </span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">described in section 5 of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/cef/wp-call/2023/call-fiche_cef-e-2023-cbrenew-prepstudies_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">call document</a></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Proposal page limits and layout:</span></b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;described in Part B of the Application Form available in the Submission System</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">2.

For the funding period 2021-2027, a new category of eligible projects features in the energy part of the revised CEF programme - <strong>cross-border projects in the field of renewable energy</strong> (hereinafter: CB RES projects) as defined in Article 7 of the CEF Regulation. The support for renewable energy under the revised CEF programme is embedded in the context of the increased ambition as per the Climate Target Plan and of the strategies on offshore renewable energy, on energy system integration and on hydrogen.</p><p>Building on the full implementation of the Fit for 55 proposals, under the REPowerEU initiative the EU has agreed on an strategy for a massive speed up and scale-up in renewable energy in power generation, buildings, industry and transport, aiming to increase the headline 2030 target for renewables from 40% to 42.5%, with the ambition to reach 45%. </p><p>The CEF funding window (= 15 % earmarking under CEF energy, i.e. 875 mn \u20ac in current prices, subject to market uptake) responds to a renewed focus on regional and cross-border cooperation in the deployment of renewable energy in Europe in the Clean Energy Package. The enewable Energy Directive (EU) states that the Commission shall support Member States\u2019 ambition level in the field of renewables through an enabling framework, including the use of Union funds, for the purpose of enhancing regional cooperation between Member States and between Member States and third countries. The new CEF window is part of this enabling framework, alongside <a href=\"https://union-renewables-development-platform.ec.europa.eu/\">the Union Renewable Development Platform</a> and the <a href=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/financing/eu-renewable-energy-financing-mechanism_en\">Renewable Energy Financing Mechanism</a>.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Directive also sets out four types of cooperation mechanisms that can be used for cooperation: statistical transfers (Art. 8), joint projects between Member States (Art. 9), joint projects between Member States and third countries (Art. 11) and joint support schemes (Art. 13). The definition of CB RES projects as per Article 2 (k) of CEF Regulation, builds up on those concepts for its eligibility criteria.</p><p>CB RES projects also contribute to the 60% climate-related spending set for the CEF with such projects counting 100% (as per Article 4 and recital 5 of the CEF Regulation) for all renewable generation (provided that for bioenergy the sustainability criteria of the Renewable Energy Directive are met).</p><p>Cooperation on the deployment of renewables allows for a more cost-effective upscaling when the locations with the best potential are used, resources are pooled and renewable generation planning and deployment takes place. Cooperation can contribute to further alignment of renewable energy policies, supports the ongoing work in regional energy forums (including the North Seas Energy Cooperation - NSEC, Baltic energy market interconnection plan - BEMIP, Central and South Eastern Europe energy connectivity - CESEC, Pentalateral Forum) and contributes to the strategic uptake of renewable technologies to maintain and expand the Union\u2019s technology leadership in the field of renewables.</p><p>CB RES projects should contribute to decarbonisation, completing the internal energy market and enhancing the security of supply by promoting the cross-border cooperation between Member States in the field of planning, development and the cost-effective exploitation of renewable energy sources.</p><p>The CB RES window for renewable energy within CEF complements other EU funding opportunities for renewable energy.</p><p>The window strongly focuses on additional renewable energy generation. Indeed, CB RES projects can have non-RES generation components only to the extend to which they comply with the conditions set out under Article 3 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/342. Namely, non-RES generation components are eligible <em>\u201cprovided that they form an integral part of the project, effectively enable the integration of and are ancillary to a renewables generation facility\u201d</em>.</p><p>Th CEF window for renewable energy will support the development of CB RES projects as well as their implementation by co-financing investments in generation assets based on any of the renewable sources listed in the Renewable Energy Directive. The investments can relate to electricity, heating &amp; cooling and transport sector investments, also when they are integrated in and framing broader investment projects e.g. on renewable hydrogen.</p><p>A CB RES project can also combine different renewable energy technologies, and it can contain a component on storage as part of the investment (both on- and off-site) or a component that is needed for the integration of the renewables generation site into the grid/heating system. Such CB RES projects must be framed under a cooperation mechanism in accordance with Articles 8 to 13 of the Renewable Energy Directive and may, but do not necessarily have to, have a physical link to more than one Member State. The cooperation mechanisms can be about an exchange of renewables statistics against a financial transfer (statistical transfer) or relate to an entire support scheme for various projects (joint support scheme) instead of linking to a specific project.</p><p>Combining CEF grants with loans, guarantees or equity contributions under InvestEU is possible. The combination of financing from the market, Member States, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, CEF, InvestEU and other Union programmes should support the necessary large-scale deployment of renewables to reach at least 42.5% of final energy consumption in renewable energy in 2030, and putting the EU on track for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p>The CEF window for renewable energy supports:</p><p>1.
